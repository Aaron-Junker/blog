No matter the size of your organization or your industry, it's almost
certain that you're doing things differently today than you were just a
few months ago. Few among us could have anticipated at the beginning of
this year just how much would change in such a short time.  In our
conversations with customers, it's fascinating---and inspiring---to hear
about their journeys from the crisis-driven early days of the pandemic
to where they are today.

 

This was a moment for heroics from IT pros and digital transformation
leaders like you: keeping people in your organization connected,
enabling remote work on a previously unimagined scale, and overcoming
challenge after challenge to maintain security and keep up to date. It
was a moment where both the virtues and the shortcomings of your
technology investments became crystal clear.  And it's been incredibly
gratifying to hear again and again from customers how Microsoft 365
enabled them to meet this moment successfully. We heard loud and clear
that those who were further along in their digital transformation
journey had an easier transition to remote work and realized more value
from Microsoft 365.  Indeed, in a survey of more than 2,000 customers
globally, **those with the most complete adoption and use of Microsoft
365 had 66 percent higher confidence in their organization's ability to
adapt and thrive** amidst uncertainty than those less far along.

 

This is the very definition of *resilience. * The move to enable remote
work was not the end of journey, but the beginning.  There is a new set
of challenges coming as we move into a fluid, hybrid work environment
where some people are working on-site, and others are still remote. 
Flexibility and adaptability will be key to success.  More than ever, it
needs to be easier for you to understand how your organization is
working and how your transformation is progressing, how technology
enables your users, and how you can get more from your Microsoft 365
licenses. That\'s why we built Microsoft Productivity Score, and we are
excited to share that there are a new set of features available today
(in preview) and when it becomes generally available on October 29.

 

**How can Productivity Score help me on my digital transformation
journey?**

To help you build a more resilient business and meet future challenges,
Productivity Score leverages the depth and breadth of Microsoft 365 to
give you insights that transform how work gets done.  It does this by
providing visibility into how your organization works, helping you
understand the employee experience in five categories: content
collaboration, meetings, communication, teamwork, and mobility.  You
also need to see how technology can better assist you in optimizing
productivity.  That's why you also get visibility into your technology
experience focusing on your endpoints, network connectivity, and
Microsoft 365 apps.

 

You need more than just visibility into how your organization works. 
That's where the insights come in.  Insights help you to enable improved
experiences across the employee and technology experience.  Lastly,
Productivity Score assists you in enabling everyone to do their best
work by taking action.  This is through actions like optimizing your
client configurations and implementing end-user training to help people
understand the benefit of a specific feature, or documentation that
enables you to optimize Microsoft 365 services\' configuration.

 

Expanding on the visibility, insights, and actions we already
[announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/bg-p/microsoft_365blog/label-name/Productivity%20Score),
here are some of the new ways that Productivity Score can help you with
your transformation starting today and on October 29.

 

**Creating more productive and engaged teams**

Many organizations tell us that it has been harder to work in teams when
everyone is remote.  As many people are now just getting used to working
this way, it will change again when some go back to the office, and
others stay remote.  With Microsoft 365 you already have the tools to
help meet this change with the shared workspaces that SharePoint,
Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft 365 Groups provide.  These shared
workspaces help create a common purpose, provide context for previous
discussions, find related documents, and quickly ramp new team members. 
The use of these workspaces is what the new Teamwork category is focused
on.

 

Available at GA, this category provides a score based on the percentage
of people who engage in teamwork within these shared workspaces.  You
will also see how this has changed over the past six months and how this
compares with the number of people who are engaging in similar
activities but not within the context of a shared workspace.

 

To help you better see the benefit of these workspaces, you also get
additional information like the level of engagement in these workspaces
so you can clear up older ones not in use anymore.  You will see a
breakdown of the number of people engaged in each type of workspace and
the number of days in a week that people are engaged in them.  Lastly,
you can see the number of shared workspaces using Microsoft Teams,
helping you encourage people to try it out and get the benefits of
staying a well-connected team.

 

As in all the other employee experience categories, you also get the
details of which people, departments, or locations are engaged in
teamwork (note that we have built privacy controls into Productivity
Score, and you can read more details on that below). Unique to this
category though, is that we also show you data on the workspaces.  This
helps you better understand the level of engagement in them.

**Making meetings more effective**

The days of having the quick hallway chat or asking a question while you
and a colleague went to the water cooler seem like a distant memory. 
The questions that drove those chats still exist, and now we try to use
email or chat messages to get them answered.  At times though, these
modes are insufficient, and you need to have a meeting.  This along with
other factors driven by remote work, have added more meetings to our
already busy calendars, and we want to help make sure that the meetings
you do take are as effective as they can be.

 

The new Meetings category available at GA will help you improve the
quality and effectiveness of meetings through the use of industry best
practices. Some of the best practices show how meetings can be more
engaging and inclusive by turning on video and screen sharing.  We also
know that it\'s top of mind for you to understand how much time people
spend in meetings each week and whether they are using these best
practices. We also show what percentage of the meetings are scheduled
ahead of time or on an ad-hoc basis and the typical length of these
meetings.  You'll also learn what percentage of people engage different
types of meetings like the use of Meet Now in Microsoft Teams channels
versus schedule one-offs or recurring meetings. This visibility can help
you devise the right action plan to drive change in the organization\'s
meetings.

.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="Meetings category home page"
style="width: 890px;"}

 

**Additional updates to existing employee experience categories and the
business continuity report**

Along with the new categories, we are also making some minor changes to
a few existing categories at GA.  In Communications, we are changing the
chart associated with what we score to help clarify what exactly was
being scored and the detailed communication channels chart is being
moved to the "Explore how your org communicates" section. Based on
feedback, we are also adding information on the number of people working
remotely and onsite to the Mobility category.  Lastly, we updated the
business continuity report at the beginning of August to show a rolling
180-day period.  This helps you focus on a more current timeframe and
maintains the relevancy of the report.

 

**Optimizing the user experience and reducing friction to enable people
to do their best work**

Hopefully it's clearer now how Productivity Score can help you move your
digital transformation goals forward, by giving you visibility into how
your users are adopting and using your productivity investments, and
helping you to focus your efforts for highest impact. But user behavior
is only half the picture.  If the underlying technology that enables
users to get work done isn't performing optimally or doesn't work as it
should, you have *friction* that works against users harnessing digital
tools to do their best work.

 

Incorrect or sub-optimal configurations, legacy hardware components,
out-of-date software versions, misbehaving software, and changes in the
environment (security/feature updates, administrative changes, Group
Policy changes, etc.) all can contribute to this friction and lie at the
root of the vast majority of endpoint performance and health issues.

 

By giving you *visibility* into the root causes of friction at the
network, endpoint and application/service levels, providing *insights*
to help you prioritize improvements, and automated *actions* to help you
detect and fix problems, Technology Experience not only can help you
improve productivity, but it can also be part of a program to lower
support costs, accelerate time-to-close support tickets, improve user
satisfaction, and raise the profile and perception of IT.

 

With that, let's take a look at what's new within Technology Experience.

 

**Microsoft 365 Apps Health**

Microsoft 365 apps are the core of your user's digital productivity;
making sure they're up to date and working properly is the goal of
Microsoft 365 Apps Health. Our research shows that giving users the best
features results in higher satisfaction, with an NPS (net promoter
score) increase of ten points. Research results also showed keeping up
to date gives you the best application performance. For example, we have
improved Outlook boot speed by 45 percent year on year.  Results also
showed that there is higher usage of collaboration features when the
apps are kept current.

 

The best way to get the full value of the apps is via the *recommended*
monthly channels, either Current Channel or Monthly Enterprise Channel. 
These monthly incremental updates help people absorb changes more
gradually and avoid larger disruptive changes.  They also provide the
most consistent cross-platform experience across Microsoft Teams, PC,
Mac, web, and mobile.

 

Microsoft 365 Apps Health, available starting today, helps you achieve
these benefits by providing you with a breakdown of how many devices are
on a supported version for each channel and how this has progressed over
the past 180 days. You also can see how many devices are running
supported releases and latest releases in each channel.  In addition,
you can see how many total devices are on supported and current release
regardless of channel, and how this has trended over time.

image-alt="Microsoft 365 Apps Health category home page"
style="width: 999px;"}

 

**Network Connectivity**

Customers tell us that overcoming connectivity problems has been one of
the most consistent challenges they've faced throughout the shift to
work from anywhere. Sub-optimal network configuration negatively impacts
team collaboration across performance sensitive scenarios including
search, document co-editing, video/audio conferencing, and more.  The
Network Connectivity category is included in Technology Experience to
help you understand and improve your connectivity to SharePoint,
Exchange and Teams and compare this against a benchmark of similar
organizations.

 

In addition to the ability to see a map of network locations for your
organization with details on service front door connectivity, you can
now use LAN subnet information, and manually submitted test reports
along with Windows Location Services to define your locations.  To learn
more about Network Connectivity, view the blog post
[here.](http://aka.ms/netignitebiz)

 

**Endpoint Analytics**

You can have a great employee experience and great networking, but if it
takes four minutes for your end users' PCs to boot up, or a problematic
service continually disrupts your users' workflow, people will not be
able to do their best work. Productivity killers like these---related to
the endpoints themselves---are exactly what Endpoint Analytics is all
about.  Endpoint Analytics is a powerful feature of Microsoft Endpoint
Manager (or MEM) that goes GA at Ignite for licensed MEM customers. It
supports data collection from both Intune and Configuration
Manager-managed endpoints.

 

Endpoint Analytics currently focuses on three areas to help you analyze
and improve endpoint performance and health problems: Startup
Performance, Recommended Software, and Proactive Remediations.  A fourth
major feature, App Reliability, will become available in the near
future.  To learn more about Endpoint Analytics, view the [GA
announcement in the MEM Tech Community](https://aka.ms/MEMEA).

 

**How Productivity Score protects user data and privacy**

With the visibility, insights, and actions available across the employee
and technology experiences, Productivity Score gives you a holistic
picture of how your organization works in a way that helps meets your
privacy requirements.  We have a strong commitment to privacy across all
of our services, which you can learn more about
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy).

 

To give you an understanding of how people are leveraging Microsoft 365
solutions and features, Productivity Score provides user-level data,
which is updated daily.  In talking to organizations in the preview,
some expressed sensitivity about this level of detail.  That is why we
previously [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/measure-and-improve-the-microsoft-365-experience-with-microsoft/ba-p/1348618)
the ability to anonymize this data. At general availability, we will
provide additional controls with the introduction of a new permissions
role called the Usage Summary Reports Reader.  Assigning a user this
role will give them access only to the organizational-level summary
information.  We will provide more information about this change at
general availability.

 

To be clear, Productivity Score is not designed as a tool for monitoring
employee work output and activities.  In fact, we safeguard against this
type of use by not providing specific information on individualized
actions, and instead only analyze user-level data aggregated over a
28-day period, so you can't see what a specific employee is working on
at a given time. Productivity Score was built to help you understand how
people are using productivity tools and how well the underlying
technology supports them in this.

** **

**How to learn more and get ready for Productivity Score**

We designed Productivity Score to provide insights that transform how
work gets done and to help you see how your technology can be an enabler
for productivity.  We are excited for you to try out Productivity Score,
