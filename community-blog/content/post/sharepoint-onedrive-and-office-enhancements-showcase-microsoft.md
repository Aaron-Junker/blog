Today at [Microsoft Ignite
2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite), we showcased recent and
upcoming innovations in SharePoint and across Microsoft 365, including
Project Cortex, a new service that applies AI to create a knowledge
network that empowers people with knowledge and expertise in the apps
they use every day, and to connect, manage, and protect content across
systems and teams.

\
Microsoft 365 uses AI to deliver cutting-edge productivity experiences
that help you get things done. In the modern workplace, content
collaboration is the foundation of productivity.

\
Industry analysts have recognized the apps in Microsoft 365, including
SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and Microsoft Stream, as
leaders for empowering customers to achieve their modern workplace. We
are proud that Gartner recently recognized Microsoft as a Leader in its
[2019 Magic Quadrant for Content Services
Platforms](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3970858?ref=clientFriendlyURL).

\
We are humbled at how the vibrant SharePoint community has embraced the
broader Microsoft 365 offerings, such as Microsoft Teams and the Power
Platform, to help Microsoft 365 empower digital transformation in more
than 500,000 customer organizations. It is this rich community that has
helped us reach another milestone: SharePoint has surpassed 100 million
monthly active commercial users in the cloud.

\
Today, I'd like to share the highlights of our innovation across the
following areas:

 

-   Knowledge
-   The intelligent intranet
-   Content and team collaboration
-   Workflow and the developer platform
-   Security and administration\
    \

## Knowledge {#toc-hId-1851450854}

With changes in the workforce, including a global skills shortage and
information overload, organizations are seeking new competitive
advantages in harnessing knowledge and "upskilling" employees. In his
keynote today, Satya Nadella shared Microsoft's vision for a new era of
Knowledge.

###  Project Cortex {#toc-hId--897219612}

[![Introducing Project
Cortex.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/154061iBD0B30C3C643EF1A/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "Project Cortex.jpg"){.lia-media-image

Cortex.]{.lia-inline-image-caption
onclick="event.preventDefault();"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="Introducing Project Cortex."
style="width: 999px;"}

As part of this vision, today we introduced Project Cortex, our first
new commercial service in Microsoft 365 since Teams.

\
Project Cortex applies AI to empower people with knowledge and expertise
in the apps they use every day. Cortex automatically organizes content
and expertise across your systems and teams into related topics like
projects, products, processes and customers, creating a **knowledge
network. Topic pages** and **knowledge centers**---created and updated
by AI---enable experts to cultivate and share knowledge with wiki-like
simplicity. And **topic cards** deliver knowledge just-in-time across
Outlook, Microsoft Teams, and Office.

 

[![topic
cards.gif](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/154063iAC73D7A054FC2CAA/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "topic cards.gif"){.lia-media-image

li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="topic cards.gif"
style="width: 800px;"}

 

In addition, Project Cortex enables business process efficiency by
turning your content into an interactive knowledge repository---with
innovations in smart content ingestion---to analyze documents and
extract metadata to create sophisticated content models; machine
teaching, to allow subject matter experts to teach the system how to
understand semi-structured content; and knowledge retrieval, to make it
easy for people to access the valuable knowledge that's so often locked
away in documents, conversations, meetings, and videos. Building on the
content you already have in SharePoint, Project Cortex connects content
across Microsoft 365 and external systems and enables you to manage
information and streamline processes with built-in security, compliance,
and workflow.

\
Many customers have joined us to help make Project Cortex, including the
Mott MacDonald Group.

\
Mott MacDonald, a global engineering and consulting firm helping clients
navigate many of the planet's most intricate challenges, operates from
180 principal offices in 50 countries. The company's leadership believes
in connected thinking---connecting people to knowledge and knowledge to
people---and Mott MacDonald is using Project Cortex to help realize this
vision. Simon Denton, productivity application architect at Mott
MacDonald, says, "I'm really excited by Microsoft's vision for creating
knowledge networks. It fits completely in with \[our\] strategy for
knowledge. The idea of connecting people to content and content to
people and building in this network out, powered by Microsoft 365: It's
going to be a game changer for us."

\
You can learn more from this morning's blog, [Introducing Project
Cortex](https://aka.ms/ProjectCortex/announce). You can also visit our
[Resource Center](https://aka.ms/ProjectCortex/Resources) to see Project
Cortex in action, review Ignite content, and apply to be part of our
limited private preview.

 

## The intelligent intranet {#toc-hId-1042104228}

For more than a decade, SharePoint has powered award-winning intranets
for hundreds of thousands of customers. With the move to the cloud,
customers have inspired us to deliver even more out-of-the-box
capabilities that accelerate time to value. Since the Future of
SharePoint event only 3 years ago, SharePoint---and the highly rated
SharePoint mobile app---have reinvented the intelligent intranet across
browsers and devices, enabling organizations to work across teams and
siloes to harness their employees' collective knowledge.

\
Today, we shared the story of the [VELUX
Group](https://aka.ms/IntelligentIntranet/CaseStudies/VeluxGroup), a
leading producer of high-quality roof windows and modular skylights. The
VELUX Group epitomizes the modern workplace, with a headquarters that's
an innovative reflection of the spirt of its founder. The VELUX Group is
proud of pioneering a digital workplace, with employees collaborating
and communicating across the world, but its classic intranet was holding
those people back. To connect more employees, help them work more
productively, and do so on their mobile devices, the VELUX Group
dedicated itself to improving its intranet. The company used Microsoft
365 to build VELUX One, an intelligent intranet that drives employee
engagement and satisfaction, enabling them to achieve more by
communicating and collaborating more effectively on more devices.

\
Ingrid Reumert, VP, Stakeholder Communications & Sustainability,
explained, "We need digital collaboration tools because we're
cooperating across boundaries and with people that we don't meet with
physically. Microsoft 365 enables us to communicate, to collaborate, to
connect across these borders."

 

[[![Velux One in

.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="Velux One in action."
style="width: 999px;"}](https://aka.ms/IntelligentIntranet/CaseStudies/VeluxGroup)

Microsoft has made great progress on this journey, but we continue to
listen to our customers' feedback so that we can drive innovation and
refinement to increase value for them. The innovations we announce today
are steeped in that rich feedback.

 

### SharePoint Home Sites {#toc-hId--1706566238}

Earlier this year at the SharePoint Conference, we previewed an
innovative step forward: SharePoint home sites. Home sites are an
intelligent, integrated employee experience---a landing page---for your
organization. We're pleased that dozens of partners have integrated
their intranet offerings closely with the intelligent intranet to
empower our customers with an extensive range of solutions that are
optimized for performance and compatibility with the SharePoint mobile
application and future innovations like home sites.  Today, I'm happy to
announce that we are beginning the rollout of SharePoint home sites,
further accelerating time to value for our customers.

 

[![SharePoint home sites - a personalized landing experience for your
organization.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/152629iF909865ECCC6856C/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "SharePointHomeSites.jpg"){.lia-media-image

.lia-image-align-inline
image-alt="SharePoint home sites - a personalized landing experience for your organization."
style="width: 999px;"}

### Multilingual capabilities {#toc-hId-36244097}

To enable global organizations to connect people across boundaries and
empower collaboration regardless of language, we are announcing that
multilingual capabilities will be available out of the box with
SharePoint.

 

Employees will be able to view content in their preferred language or
easily switch languages. Page translators will receive notification of
changes to core content, and with real-time difference tracking, they'll
be able to update that content easily and efficiently.

 

[![Multilingual

.lia-image-align-inline
image-alt="Difference tracking helps translators focus only on what changed."
style="width: 999px;"}

In addition, new languages are available in Microsoft Stream. With
Microsoft Stream, you can embed videos in any site by using the
out-of-the-box web part, enabling transcripts and captions for videos in
Chinese (simplified), French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese
(Brazilian).

 

### Enhancements for corporate communicators {#toc-hId-1779054432}

We continue to listen and innovate to help corporate communicators share
their stories and messages across their organizations. Today, we
announced a series of enhancements in that area, from page scheduling
and out-of-the-box stock photography to new web parts, live event
enhancements, and more.

 

[![Rich stock photography to enhance your news and sites

## Content and team collaboration {#toc-hId--576589024}

You saw the story of [Nestlé](https://aka.ms/OneDriveNestle), the global
food and beverage giant that makes so much of what we consume, from
coffee to pet food. Headquartered in Vevey, Switzerland, Nestlé is the
largest food and drink producer in the world. In 2015, the company
embarked on a journey to reduce infrastructure, strengthen digital
collaboration, and secure that collaboration by deploying OneDrive.

 

A Herculean migration task lay before Nestlé, which has more than
300,000 employees and 1,500 office locations (including 500 factories)
in more than 70 countries. But Nestlé found that once it started to roll
out OneDrive, the process perpetuated itself, reduced costs, and made
employees' lives easier.

 

Nestlé executives Jose Luis Di Rauso, AVP, Network and Unified
Communications, shared, "We use Microsoft OneDrive to enable our users
to share content and collaborate with higher levels of versatility and
freedom, removing dependencies on IT departments as well as complex
designs when collaboration with external parties is required."

\
With Nestlé and so many other organizations using Microsoft 365 to drive
content and team collaboration today, we continue to work for
innovations that help them be even more productive.

 

For example, Microsoft Office has always helped you manage your work,
whether you're using the web, desktop, or mobile applications. Some of
the new collaboration and AI capabilities in SharePoint; OneDrive; and
Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint will make that management even
easier.

 

### Add Microsoft Teams to your site {#toc-hId-969707806}

We are making it easier than ever to bring all that rich content and
business processes you've been working on together into one place in
Teams, your hub for teamwork.

 

You can already add a team to your existing group-connected SharePoint
site with one click. Today, we want to share that we're building a new,
more intuitive way to do the same thing directly from SharePoint. We'll
make it easy to choose lists, libraries, or pages that you want to bring
into Teams as tabs. Once in Teams, it is easy to collaborate with the
same group directly on the SharePoint content you just brought in.

### OneDrive {#toc-hId--1582449155}

OneDrive is the intelligent files app for Microsoft 365. From OneDrive,
you access all your files across individual locations and shared team
libraries.

 

Today, I'm happy to announce that we're improving OneDrive in four key
areas:

 

-   Improved file insights that are actionable with File Cards
-   A new way of sharing with Request Files
-   Improved working with extremely large files and saving on network
    bandwidth with Differential Sync
-   Keeping you productive when you're on the go\
    \

announcements](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/Content-collaboration-throughout-Microsoft-365-Ignite-2019/ba-p/960868)
blog from this morning.

 

### A refreshed Office.com {#toc-hId-160361180}

Today, we announced a new, refreshed Office.com that connects you to the
apps you use every day, including line-of-business apps.

 

[![The new
Office.com.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/152639i432201E88647BA67/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "office.jpg"){.lia-media-image

Microsoft Search is available at the top of the page to make content
discovery fast and efficient. In addition, AI recommends items such as
documents, \@mentions, videos from Microsoft Stream, or news from
SharePoint that require your attention---all designed so that you can
easily get back to your work as easily as possible.

 

These experiences are available today, with design updates rolling out
soon. For example, over the next few months, you will gain the ability
to add templates customized for your organization in SharePoint,
including your branding, fonts, and colors.

 

### Intelligence and collaboration enhancements to Office {#toc-hId-1188010226}

Office has been the leader in collaboration and using intelligence to
help make you more productive. Today, we shared enhancements to Word,
Excel, and PowerPoint based on intelligence to help make you more
productive, share information more effectively, and collaborate with
teammates. We are showing many new innovations in Office here at Ignite,
such as:

 

-   Using your enterprise templates in PowerPoint Designer.
-   Enhancing collaboration through the new commenting experience and
    task tracking in Word. 
-   Improving the coauthoring experience in Excel with Sheet view.\
    \

## Workflow and the developer platform {#toc-hId-432804624}

[The Jim Henson Company](https://aka.ms/IntelligentIntranet/JimHenson),
a leader in family entertainment for more than 60 years, has always been
innovative. As the company began its push to the cloud, it was looking
for a quick fix to help its security team. Having provided solutions in
the past, The Jim Henson Company looked to the PAIT Group for a creative
solution to its needs.

 

The Jim Henson Company decided to take advantage of the modern tool sets
available within Microsoft 365 and expand on SharePoint lists with
PowerApps to rapidly create a more modern-looking, user-friendly tool.

 

"As a long-time Microsoft customer, we are thrilled to see collaboration
tools that are flexible enough to manage screenplays at the office and
yet be mobile friendly enough to use on a production set," says Tobias
Iaconis, VP of Information Systems at The Jim Henson Company.

 

Microsoft 365 supports a broad spectrum of options, from a rich workflow
that empowers employees who have little or no coding background to
streamline and improve the processes they use to get work done to a
robust developer platform. We continue to listen and strive to enable
our customers to save time and money and ensure that processes are
designed by the people who know them best. Today, we highlight efforts
in this area.

 

### Office Script {#toc-hId-378663600}

Office Scripting simplifies clunky processes and automates repetitive
tasks so that you can work less while doing more. Today, we introduced
scripting in Excel, a new process automation feature that enables you to
record your actions inside a workbook and save it to a script. You can
then integrate the saved script with Power Automate and schedule it to
run automatically or integrate with a larger flow. Office Scripting will
be available as a public preview by the end of the year.

###  Document library improvements {#toc-hId-2121473935}

We continue to further enhance lists and libraries in SharePoint based
on your feedback. To that end, we are releasing all new functionality in
this area, such as:

 

-   Expanding lists to fill the screen, which enables you to focus on
    what you're doing and see more rows and columns at once.
-   Customizing the view, which is something you told us was important.
    We are making it simple to customize your view with powerful new
    tools to slice and dice your data, be it list items or metadata on
    docs.
-   Integrating PowerApps with SharePoint document libraries.\
    \

### Fluid Framework {#toc-hId--430683026}

At Build 2019, we announced Fluid Framework, a combination of new
technology and experiences that will make collaboration seamless by
breaking down the barriers between apps. Today, we're announcing a
public preview experience to try the Fluid Framework. Microsoft 365
customers can as we begin our rollout in the next few weeks. Over time,
we expect these capabilities to appear in experiences across Microsoft
365, including within chat in Teams, mail in Microsoft Outlook, portals
in SharePoint, notes in OneNote, and Office documents. We're also
announcing a private preview of the technology, and we're inviting
organizations that would like to partner with us on the initial release
of the Fluid Framework to sign up for the [developer
preview](https://aka.ms/FluidDeveloperPreview).

 

## Security and administration {#toc-hId--1185888628}

Microsoft runs on trust. With the growing presence and sophistication of
online threats, it's increasingly important to have the right protection
and tools to help safeguard your devices, personal information, and
files against being compromised.

 

With growing pools of digital data in your organization, simplified
governance of this data and the ability to stay current with compliance
are becoming critical for business success. With our new AI-powered
features, you can simplify and automate risk management and keep your
data secure, despite ever-evolving threats.

 

### Automatic classification {#toc-hId--1240029652}

At Ignite 2018, we showed you how sensitivity labels make it easy to
protect and govern your business-critical data by manually labeling the
data. With sensitivity labels, we're taking our next big step forward
and introducing automatic classification.

 

Microsoft 365 can automatically identify the sensitive data in your
corporate files based on the rules you configure and label that data to
protect it and ensure that only authorized employees can access it. You
can associate richer policies, like device policies and external user
policies, to a label, meeting your corporate security requirements while
at the same time offering employees a simplified experience.

###  Information barriers {#toc-hId-502780683}

We are also developing our compliance controls. We shipped Office 365
Multi-Geo for data residency needs in SharePoint Online this spring.
Now, we're taking a leap forward with the information barriers scenario.
Initially available in Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive, this enforcement
technology will come to Exchange Online and other Microsoft 365
experiences.

 

With OneDrive and SharePoint, your data is in the most secure and
compliant place. You can lean more in the blog [SharePoint and OneDrive
Security, compliance, migration, admin and server -- Ignite 2019
announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/SharePoint-and-OneDrive-Security-compliance-migration-admin-and/ba-p/960871).

 

### A richer administrative toolkit {#toc-hId--2049376278}

Microsoft 365 provides a rich toolkit that enables IT professionals to
configure, manage, and monitor Microsoft 365 services. As in all areas
of the product, we continue to listen to customer feedback and innovate.
Today, we announced a series of new administrative features to enhance
this toolkit:

 

-   **Root site URL rename.** One particularly popular request is to
    enable you to modernize your root site by replacing it with a new,
    modern home site that you have built. I'm happy to share that you
    can now do that with one click from within the SharePoint admin
    center.
-   **Modern term store.** From your feedback, we also know that you're
    excited for us to finish modernizing the remaining classic
    experiences. Today, I showed the new term store admin experience
    we're working on. The new experience will offer an enhanced set of
    analytics and make it easier to manage your company's taxonomy and
    content types.
-   **Mover.** Last week, I had the privilege of announcing that
    [Microsoft has acquired
    Mover](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/10/21/microsoft-acquires-mover-to-simplify-and-speed-file-migration-to-microsoft-365/),
    a leading provider of cloud file migration, including admin-led and
    self-service offerings. As customer demand to move content to the
    cloud continues to grow, Mover will help make it easier than ever
    for customers to migrate files to Microsoft 365. You can now use
    this service for free. Initially, the service is available to North
    American customers, but we plan to ramp up for all customers
    worldwide. We'll share more soon.

Mover offers many new cloud migration scenarios alongside our SharePoint
Migration Tool for on-premises moves, FastTrack planning and onboarding,
and a strong migration partner ecosystem---collectively, the broadest
set of offerings to assist your migration to Microsoft 365.

 

## Inspiration and next steps {#toc-hId-1490385416}

The innovations and vision we announced today are inspired by you---your
success, your stories, your questions, and your wish lists. Our team
listens closely and creates capabilities that we hope will in turn
inspire you to transform your organization into a modern workplace.
