## These *are* the web parts you\'re looking for. {#toc-hId--497287925}

The *[PnP Modern Search web
parts](https://microsoft-search.github.io/pnp-modern-search/)*, out of
all of the [hundreds of samples
available](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-webparts/) as a part of the
PnP initiative, are some of the *most* complicated web parts to get
configured.

 

Between the four of them, there\'s somewhere around 100 different
configuration options, which can be configured into countless
combinations; and if you want to make the most out of them, you\'re also
going to need to be somewhat familiar with SharePoint Search topics such
as *managed* and *crawled* properties, refiners, result sources, etc\...

 

Point is, these web parts are not meant for the masses and can be a
challenge even for the most super of super users.

 

The aim of this post is to, hopefully, lessen that challenge a bit. And
to do that, we\'re going to be using these web parts to build a page for
searching a SharePoint list of the top 999 video games (by \# of units
shipped).

 

We\'re not going to be deep diving into every option or combination of
setting. Instead, we\'re going for the classic \"Minimal Path to
Awesome\"\...with a few detours throughout.

li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="16-final.png" style="width: 839px;"}

 

## Getting the Web Parts {#toc-hId-1990224908}

The latest version of the PnP Modern Search web parts can be found using
[this
link](https://github.com/microsoft-search/pnp-modern-search/releases/latest).

 

For the purposes of this blog, we\'re looking at v4.1.0, which can be
found using [this
link](https://github.com/microsoft-search/pnp-modern-search/releases/tag/4.1.0)
(in case it\'s no longer the latest).

 

Just scroll down to the bottom of the page and download the `.SPPKG`
file.

 

Once you have those, you can follow along with the [installation
guide](https://microsoft-search.github.io/pnp-modern-search/installation/)
to get them in your tenant.

 

## Setting up for the demo {#toc-hId-182770445}

If you\'re interested in following along with the demo in your own
environment, there\'s a bit of behind-the-scenes work that was done to
stage things.

 

I\'ve included a PnP Site template and a README in the [github
repository](https://github.com/willholland/blog-using-pnp-search) for
this blog to help get you up to speed.

 

## Configuring the Search Box web part {#toc-hId--1624684018}

In keeping with the spirit of our \"Minimal Path to Awesome\" approach,
the Search Box web part will be the easiest to configure of the lot. We
can just drop it on the page somewhere and be done.

 

[![4-search-box.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267726i257D999E0305C7AE/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "4-search-box.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267726i257D999E0305C7AE?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267726i257D999E0305C7AE'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="4-search-box.png"
style="width: 614px;"}

 

That doesn\'t mean, however, that it has to be that simple. Version 4
has introduced more advanced features than we\'ll be making use of, but
that doesn\'t mean we can\'t take a peek.

 

### Panel 1 - Search box settings {#toc-hId--934122544}

The first configuration panel initially offers two settings.

 

[![5-search-box-settings.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267711iED7D52936AC4F68C/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "5-search-box-settings.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267711iED7D52936AC4F68C?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267711iED7D52936AC4F68C'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="5-search-box-settings.png"
style="width: 338px;"}

 

The first setting will replace the default \"*Enter your search
terms\...*\" placeholder text with whatever you type here.

 

The second setting - **Send the query to a new page** - will be off by
default (and will stay that way for this example). If you enable it,
you\'ll see some new options appear that allow you send the user\'s
query to a new page/tab.

 

This can be incredibly useful if you want to create \"Search Results\"
page like what we\'re currently doing, but also want to provide a search
box on other pages. Using this we could, for example, include a Search
box web part on the home page of our site and, when a user submits a
query, the query is passed to the page we\'re building, and search
results are shown.

 

### Panel 2 - Query Suggestions {#toc-hId-1553390289}

It\'s possible to provide users with some search suggestions (you know,
the things that appear beneath what you\'re typing in search engines
like Bing or Google) to help speed them along their search journey.

 

As users search for a particular term or phrase and click on search
results, SharePoint will (supposedly) make a correlation between the
two. In our example, if a user searched for ***World of Warcraft*** and
clicked on the result ***World of Warcraft: Legion*** six times,
SharePoint would begin suggesting ***World of Warcraft: Legion*** as a
potential query.

 

> **NOTE**: I used the word *supposedly* earlier because I never saw
> this feature working in my example. I assume this is either because
> the search results we\'re creating aren\'t clickable, or that the
> Search suggestions are only curated when you\'re using the built-in
> search boxes, such as the Microsoft Search bar.

### Panel 3 - Available Connections {#toc-hId--254064174}

The last panel of options includes configurations that allow us to pull
queries from other sources.

 

[![6-search-box-available-connections.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267712i66AB2348FEE13EB1/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "6-search-box-available-connections.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267712i66AB2348FEE13EB1?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267712i66AB2348FEE13EB1'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline
image-alt="6-search-box-available-connections.png"
style="width: 331px;"}

 

Again, we\'re not going to be dealing with these on our MPA. However,
referring to the example of having a search box on a home page sending
queries to the page we\'re currently building, we would want to select
the \"Query string\" option here and specify our parameter name. Once
configured, we could pass query information from one page and pull it in
here.

 

## Configuring the Search Verticals web part {#toc-hId--264567278}

Verticals allow users to limit their search results to a specific *kind*
of result. If you\'ve been around SharePoint long enough, you\'ve no
doubt seen the standard *All*, *Files*, *People*, *Sites*, etc\...
verticals that SharePoint shows when you search for stuff.

 

Well, the *Search Verticals* web part allows us to create our own
verticals that enable our users to see results for specific platforms.

 

In terms of difficulty, the *Search Verticals* web part comes in second
place in our example, although it\'s probably the easiest to configure
overall if you count the Search Box features we\'re not making use of.

 

[![7-search-verticals.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267713iA207B0FA5C88DC91/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "7-search-verticals.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267713iA207B0FA5C88DC91?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267713iA207B0FA5C88DC91'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="7-search-verticals.png"
style="width: 956px;"}

 

While the other three web parts in this package saw new features (and
added complexity) with the latest version, this web part is actually
became much easier to use. There\'s only one configuration panel to deal
with, so let\'s take a look.

 

### Panel 1 - Search verticals configuration {#toc-hId-425994196}

When you open the Search Verticals web part, you\'ll be greated with a
singular button that says **Configure Verticals**.

 

[![8-meme.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267714iDC324078C33051CF/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "8-meme.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267714iDC324078C33051CF?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267714iDC324078C33051CF'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="8-meme.png" style="width: 540px;"}

 

When clicked, you get the real deal\...

 

[![9-real-deal.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267715iCDC68C766A45489C/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "9-real-deal.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267715iCDC68C766A45489C?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267715iCDC68C766A45489C'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="9-real-deal.png"
style="width: 999px;"}

 

We can add any number of verticals simply by giving them a name and
setting an order. We can also make use of the standard Fabric icons if
we wish (and we do!) and, if we choose, we can make verticals a link
that opens a new page when clicked.

 

Since we want our users to stay on the same page, we\'re not going to
bother with hyperlinks, but we will go ahead and create verticals for
the latest generation of platforms available in our dataset, as well as
an \"All\" vertical.

 

### Search Verticals Summary {#toc-hId--1381460267}

That\'s all there is to it, really. However, one important thing to keep
in mind is that each vertical you choose to add will require a separate
instance of the Search Results web part. For those that are familiar
with previous versions of these web parts, this is a deparature from
what we\'re used to.

 

## Configuring the Search Refiners web part {#toc-hId-281806368}

Once a user gets to searching, they may want to be able to filter the
results by certain criteria. We can use the *Search Filters* web part to
fulfil that demand.

 

### Panel 1 - Available Connections {#toc-hId--1396565376}

For refiners to show, they\'ll need search results to refine. The
\"Available connections\" settings will allow you select one or more
*Search Results* web parts. If you haven\'t already added one, there
won\'t be any options, so make sure you\'ve added one first. Once
you\'ve got one, select it here.

 

Later, you\'ll see that we end up with multiple *Search Results* web
parts, so we\'ll revisit this after that point to update it so our
refiners respect that.

 

### Panel 1 - Filter Settings {#toc-hId-1090947457}

The other section has two different settings we can configure.

style="width: 503px;"}

 

Clicking the edit button will, again, open a meme-worthy panel. Unlike
the last panel, though, this new panel is far more involved.

 

[![19-refiners-settings.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267717i9367A970A25158F0/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "19-refiners-settings.png"){.lia-media-image

.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="19-refiners-settings.png"
style="width: 820px;"}

 

Most of the settings are, I think, self explanatory and you can see the
settings used for the demo in the above screenshot.

 

However, it\'s important to note that the values you use in the \"Filter
field\" column **MUST** map to a managed property that has been marked
as Refinable. In our case, we\'ve already gone into our search schema
and mapped the columns we wanted to filter by to the provided Refinable
managed properties.

 

> **NOTE:** If you\'ve applied the PnP template referenced earlier,
> these settings will have already been mapped for you.

### Panel 2 - Available Layouts {#toc-hId--716507006}

We have three pre-canned layouts available to us, as well as a Custom
option which you can use to present your filters in any way you can
imagine.

 

[![17-vertical-layouts.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267718i0C8E2EB891A16348/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "17-vertical-layouts.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267718i0C8E2EB891A16348?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267718i0C8E2EB891A16348'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="17-vertical-layouts.png"
style="width: 321px;"}

 

The *Vertical* and *Horizontal* options are self-descriptive, while the
*Panel* option will cause a panel to flyout from the right (like how the
web part properties do).

 

Since our Filter web part is in a vertical column, we\'ll just stick
with that option.

 

## Configuring the Search Results web part. {#toc-hId-1641923108}

The *Search Results* web part is, as the name implies, the component we
use to show search results for the things users are searching for. It\'s
also where things start getting little more involved.

 

[![10-search-results.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267719iE06F09A4C2F29E52/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "10-search-results.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267719iE06F09A4C2F29E52?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267719iE06F09A4C2F29E52'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="10-search-results.png"
style="width: 758px;"}

 

Unlike the previous web parts, there are a lot of different settings,
combinations, and customization potential in this web part. Since we\'re
focused on just getting a quick win, we\'ll mostly be sticking to the
basics.

 

### Panel 1 - Available data sources {#toc-hId--36448636}

The first section we must deal with is choosing where we will pull
search results from: SharePoint or Microsoft Search?

 

[![11-search-sources.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267720iE87917BF92F12425/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "11-search-sources.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267720iE87917BF92F12425?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267720iE87917BF92F12425'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="11-search-sources.png"
style="width: 215px;"}

 

As was mentioned in the at the beginning of this blog, all our data is
in SharePoint, so we\'re just going to go with that. We could, of
course, use Microsoft Search to get the data as well\...but we\'ll leave
that for another time. Just note that if you decide to go forward with
Microsoft Search, some of the configuration options will change based on
that context.

 

### Panel 1 - Layout slots {#toc-hId--1843903099}

If you click the Customize button, you\'ll be presented with another
flyout panel with a bunch of default entries. There\'s a brief
description at the top that tries to explain what these are, but
honestly didn\'t make much sense to me in the beginning.

 

Search results are, behind the scenes, being rendered using
[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each one of these
*Slots* will create a variable that can be referenced in a template and
is tied back to a property returned in the search results.

 

[![12-slots.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267721iD47ABA757DADF88B/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "12-slots.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267721iD47ABA757DADF88B?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267721iD47ABA757DADF88B'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="12-slots.png" style="width: 890px;"}

 

Considering the above, there will be a property exposed in the
Handlebars template called \"Author\" that is mapped to the
\"AuthorOWSUSER\" managed property.

 

For those of us walking the *minimalist* path, this isn\'t necessary.
However, the search results shown in screenshots does make use of custom
templates and does rely on some custom layout slots to tie into the
managed properties associated with our list of video games. Below is a
table of the mappings for those following along.

 

  Slot name   Slot field
  ----------- ----------------------
  Developer   DeveloperOWSCHCS
  Rating      ESRBRatingOWSCHCS
  Genre       GenreOWSCHCS
  IMGURL      imgurlOWSURLH
  Platform    PlatformOWSCHCS
  Publisher   PublisherNameOWSCHCS
  Rank        RankOWSN
  Year        YearOWSNMBR

### Panel 1 - SharePoint Search {#toc-hId-643609734}

This section has a lot going on and is our first real chance to
influence what search results are surfaced for the user.

 

#### Query Template {#toc-hId--1034762010}

The first option is the *Query template* text box. By default, it will
simply have `{searchTerms}` loaded into it, which acts as a token to
represent whatever search query is being fed to the web part. In our
case, that will be whatever the user has typed into the *Search Box* web
part. You can enter your KQL query here, which can enable you to
restrict search results to, say, a particular content type ID like
so\...

 

    {searchTerms} ContentTypeId:0x01004527A5975C6A534DAE7EBFD57E41A633*

In this case, the content type ID being used is for a \"Video Game
Data\" content type that is used for items in our list. So, by doing
this, we\'re limiting our search results to only those that match our
content type.

 

This also gives the benefit of displaying default search results when
the user enters the page, which is pretty useful in our example.

 

#### Result source ID {#toc-hId-1452750823}

Immediately below that is the *Result source ID* field, which allows you
select a SharePoint Search Result Source. By default, it will be set to
**LocalSharePointResults**. If you\'re using the method above, you can
leave it there. The other option is to create your own custom Search
Results type to limit results to our content type and supply the GUID
for that here. The end result is the same, ultimately.

 

#### Selected Properties {#toc-hId-343458301}

Next up is the *Selected Properties* dropdown. The web part will have
several properties selected by default, and if you\'re just wanting to
leverage the default layout options, you can leave this alone as well.
If, however, you want to display different properties on your search
results you can (de)select as many options as you need. You won\'t be
able to make use of any property you haven\'t included here though, so
bear that in mind.

 

Our search results don\'t need any of the default options. Instead, you
can just copy & paste the below string into the text box to get going.

 

    DeveloperOWSCHCS,ESRBRatingOWSCHCS,GenreOWSCHCS,imgurlOWSURLH,PlatformOWSCHCS,PublisherNameOWSCHCS,RankOWSNMBR,Title,YearOWSNMBR

Each one of those values points to a managed property that was created
when our site columns were provisioned and allows us to show that data
on our result cards.

 

#### Sort order {#toc-hId--1463996162}

I think this one is fairly self explanatory. You select a managed
property (or properties), things get sorted as you specify.

 

[![13-sort.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267722i528DE23A76C574E1/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "13-sort.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267722i528DE23A76C574E1?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267722i528DE23A76C574E1'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="13-sort.png" style="width: 999px;"}

 

The only thing to keep in mind here is that the property you select must
be marked as being sortable in the Search schema, which they won\'t be
by default and is why we\'re referencing *RefinableInt00* in the
screenshot above, which has been mapped to the *Rank* column in our
list.

 

#### Refinement filters {#toc-hId-1023516671}

You can add additional filters to search results here. This is another
way, like the *Query text* example above, to limit what results are
returned.

 

We could totally add our
`ContentTypeId:0x01004527A5975C6A534DAE7EBFD57E41A633*` filter here, if
we chose, instead of the *Query text* box above.

 

The biggest difference would be that we wouldn\'t see any search results
until the user actually searched for something.

 

#### The other options\... {#toc-hId--783937792}

There are five other options available in this section which are
somewhat self explantory. The only exception to the rule might be the
*Enable query rules* options, which is more than we\'re going to get
into here (and honestly not something I\'m familiar with).

 

### Panel 1 - Paging options {#toc-hId-1574492322}

This section, as the name implies, allows you to configure paging
options. They\'re all straight forward and the only one we changed for
the demo was the *Number of items per page*, which we set to 9 - the
idea being that we wanted to show three cards per row (which left a
straggler if we lef it at the default 10).

 

### Panel 2 - Available layouts {#toc-hId--232962141}

This panel is more straight forward that the last. Select a layout and
configure any common or layout specific options you want.

 

[![14-layouts.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267723i291AFAAE61A74B3C/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "14-layouts.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267723i291AFAAE61A74B3C?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267723i291AFAAE61A74B3C'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="14-layouts.png"
style="width: 305px;"}

 

The complexity will come in when you want to customize the visual
appearance of the search results. Many of the non-custom layouts have
configuration options that allow you to influence the appearance, but
all of them will require some familiarity with Handlebars to get the
most out of them.

 

If you\'re just using these web parts to surface standard SharePoint
content, such as Pages or Documents, the non-custom layouts should suit
your needs perfectly.

 

For the hardcore, you can also go full custom and get as creative as
you\'d like. We\'re using the custom layout in our *Search Results* web
parts, the source for which can be [found on
github.](https://github.com/willholland/blog-using-pnp-search/blob/main/card.html)

 

> **NOTE:** For the custom layout to function, you will need to ensure
> that you\'ve defined the custom Slots referenced earlier in the blog.

### Panel 3 - Available Connections {#toc-hId--2040416604}

The last panel of options allows us to connect the other web parts we
have on our page which, in turn, allows them to influence our search
results.

 

The first option is whether to *Use input query text*, which is **Off**
by default. This setting basically controls whether we want to allow
search queries.

 

Leaving it off might seem odd, but if we didn\'t want users to search
via text and instead use verticals, refiners, or just browse through
result pages of the query we specified back on the first panel\'s *Query
template*, that\'s how we\'d do it.

 

However, we definitely want to flip that on, otherwise our *Search Box*
web part will be about as useful as a glass nail. Once on, you can
select Dynamic Value and select the **PnP - Search Box** option.

 

[![15-input-query.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267724i872059846FCDB3C1/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "15-input-query.png"){.lia-media-image
role="button"
li-image-url="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267724i872059846FCDB3C1?v=v2"
li-image-display-id="'267724i872059846FCDB3C1'"
li-message-uid="'2239771'" li-messages-message-image="true"
li-bindable="" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true"
li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="15-input-query.png"
style="width: 326px;"}

 

We\'ll also want to go ahead and connect our filters web part, which is
as simple as toggling the switch and selecting the only item in the
dropdown.

 

Lastly, we\'ll want to connect to our verticals web part, which is only
slightly more complicated than the refiners. As you\'ll see, we have a
second dropdown that is labeled *Display data only when the following
vertical is selected*.

 

To start with, just select the **All** option. Once that\'s done, in
order to support all of our verticals, we\'ll need to actually duplicate
the web part we just configured for each additional vertical (4 times,
in our example) and update each one to show during a different vertical.
It\'s a bit heavy handed for our example, but extremely useful if you
intend to display different layouts for different verticals.

 

Once you\'ve duplicated your *Search Results* web part, be sure to
update the **Available Connections** setting in your *Search Refiners*
web part to include these additions.

 

## Conclusion {#toc-hId-318013510}

If you\'ve followed along with everything, you should have a page that
looks something like the below\...

 

[![16-final.png](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267725iAFCDD5249E25C51B/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "16-final.png"){.lia-media-image

li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="16-final.png" style="width: 839px;"}

 

These web parts are amazingly cool, extremely powerful, and can be
leveraged to create a lot of awesome experiences for our users.

 

It\'s also one of the most complicated web parts out there. While this
blog post was (mostly) focused on that \"minimal path to awesome\",
it\'s still ***REALLY*** long, which speaks to some of that complexity.
However, hopefully this has helped make it more accessible to get
started.

 

At a minimum, you\'ve at least learned that *Wii Sports* is the most
shipped game of all time\...so you\'ve got that going for you, which is
nice.
