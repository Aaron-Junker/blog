Over the past few years you have likely noticed that the way people work
is changing. They work more collaboratively, frequently spin up new
teams, and need to work anywhere and anytime.  You look to Microsoft 365
as the world's productivity cloud to help support this new culture of
work and to enable people to be productive so they can drive business
impact.  As productivity and technology are intertwined, we also hear
that you want to know how your technology is enabling people to be
productive and do their best work.  To help you on this journey to
support this new culture of work, today we are announcing Microsoft
Productivity Score. 

 

Productivity Score gives you insights that transform how work gets
done.  It will provide you visibility into how your organization works,
insights that identify where you can enable improved experiences so
people can reach their goals, and actions to update skills and systems
so everyone can do their best work.  Let's dive into each of these areas
in more detail starting with visibility into how your organization
works.

 

**Visibility into how your organization works**

One of the most noticeable ways we help you see how you are transforming
how work gets done is via the score.  There are two categories that your
score is built from, the employee experience and the technology
experience.  Both categories include a benchmark that helps you compare
how you are doing compared to organizations similar to yours.  The
employee experience shows how Microsoft 365 is helping to create a
productive and engaged workforce by quantifying how people collaborate
on content, work from anywhere, understanding communication styles, and
developing a meeting culture.  The technology experience helps you
ensure the technology isn't getting in the way by assisting you optimize
your device experiences such as proactively remediating common helpdesk
issues and improving PC startup times, and your network to ensure your
apps work well.

Visibility into where you are today and how you have progressed is
great, but we understand that you are going to want advice on what you
could do next and that is where the insights come in.

 

**Insights that identify where you can enable improved experiences**

Within employee experience there are three different types of insights. 
The first is the primary insight which is what you see on the home page
and at the top of the details page for an area.  What we are measuring
in this insight is what will directly impact the score.  We also provide
academic insights to help you understand the correlation of what we are
measuring to productivity.  You will see these on the right side of the
details page for an area. The final type is a supporting insight which
gives you contextual details that drive actionability in support of the
primary insight.

Within technology experience there are insights for each area you are
attempting to optimize. For example, legacy hardware, poorly tuned
policies, or the presence of 3^rd^ party agents can impact PC startup
performance. While network performance can impact Teams call quality and
OneDrive for Business.

image-alt="PC startup performance insight in the technology experience page"
style="width: 416px;"}

Now that you understand what your organization could be doing to change
how people work, what actions can you take to start that process?

 

**Actions** **to update skills and systems so everyone can do their best
work**

To drive change and help people work in new ways there are a few actions
you might want to take like raise awareness of a feature or solution,
plan training to help people learn how to use a feature, you might need
to enable features or services if they are not up and running, or update
your configuration to better enable the use of a solution. 

 

To see the actions that you might want to take in the employee
experience, you can click on the view actions button in the primary
insight or the link at the bottom of a supporting insight.  Doing this
opens the recommended actions panel with options that you might
consider.  For example, some of the actions recommended in the
collaborating on content area are focused on providing end user training
around how to better collaborate and how to create links to documents in
emails instead of sending attachments.  There is also documentation for
IT to understand how to configure external sharing.

 

[![Recommended actions for collaborating on content

.lia-image-align-inline
image-alt="Recommended actions for collaborating on content area"
style="width: 999px;"}

Within technology experience, we provide recommended actions like tuning
policies, removing problem agents, or upgrading hardware to improve
startup performance. Also, to reduce support tickets we provide
pre-canned "proactive remediations" to fix issues on devices before
people even know there is a problem.

**Join the private preview**

If you would like to see what your score is and help shape the product,
you can sign up for the private preview.  There will be a preview for
the employee experience and one for the technology experience.  We are

cloud.  For the technology experience you must have at least 50 Intune
or co-managed (ConfigMgr managed plus Intune enrolled) Windows 10
devices on version 1903 or higher.

 

To request access to the private preview please fill out the form at
<https://aka.ms/productivityscorepreview>. 

 

If you join the employee experience preview you will see a Productivity
Score entry under reports in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center the week of
December 3^rd^.  If you request to join the technology experience
preview, we will let you know if you have been accepted by December
3^rd^.

 

Update: December 6th, 2019\
If you requested access to the employee experience preview on or before
November 27th and provided us with valid information you should now see
the experience enabled in the Reports section of the left navigation
pane within the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. If you submitted your
request after November 27th, we will process your request around the
15th of each month.

 

Please submit feedback on your experience using the "Give Feedback"
button in the bottom right of any page within the employee experience.

 

Thanks for your interest in Productivity Score and we hope you are
excited as we are about it.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or
