[Microsoft Ignite](https://myignite.microsoft.com/home), our yearly
flagship event for Microsoft products and technologies, is a 48-hour
digital event experience taking place from September 22-24,
2020. Ignite, of course, is a very different event this year. On the one
hand, it is a single global event where everyone gets the same news,
information, content, and experience at the same time. But on the other
hand, I will miss the many personal connections that take place at our
in-person events. I look forward to the day when in-person events
resume, but until then, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share
with you now an amazing collection of video content covering the
incredible work being done across Microsoft 365.

 

Last year, the [[admin track at
Ignite](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/the-microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2019/ba-p/953950)]{.underline}
had several breakout, theater, and learning path sessions from several
engineering teams, such as:

-   the Microsoft 365 admin center team---the team that builds the
    Microsoft 365 admin center and admin mobile app;
-   Release and Delivery Experiences---the team that builds, among other
    things, Office.com and Office What's New;
-   Microsoft 365 Groups---the team that builds the Microsoft 365 Groups
    platform, membership service, and user experiences; and
-   Microsoft 365 Complex Orgs---the team that builds features and
    experiences to support customer mergers, acquisitions, and
    divestitures, and cross-tenant collaboration.

Since last Ignite, each of these teams has been immersed in customer
feedback and working hard to deliver your most-wanted admin experiences.
At an in-person Ignite, they'd be up on stage telling you all about what
they've been up to for the past year. But since we can't do that, I am
thrilled to announce that we've done the next best thing -- a digital
admin track!

 

The Microsoft 365 Admin Tools and Experiences track has a slew of new
videos that announce new features and ways to connect with Microsoft 365
engineering teams. These videos detail the new features and experiences
we have delivered and are delivering to you. They highlight what we've
done over the past year and why we've done it, and they give you a
glimpse into what we're doing next and why. Watch these videos not just
for the content, but also for the opportunities they give you to engage
directly with these feature teams and register your interest for
upcoming previews, roundtables, and other product team engagements.

 

There are 18 across three broad themes:

-   IT efficiency and agility;
-   [Modern cloud
    management](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2020-part-2-modern-cloud/ba-p/1669526 "Modern cloud management");
    and
-   [Investments in complex
    organizations](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2020-part-3-investments-in/ba-p/1669547 "Investments in complex organizations")

This post covers IT efficiency and agility. Improved IT efficiency and
agility means, in part, helping you to become a more efficient admin by
allowing you to do things like delegate tasks, to increase the speed of
task completion, and to improve your productivity. It also means greater
flexibility for you in your work. It means giving you rich admin
experiences when you're on the go. It means having insight into the
health of your organization. And it means using that insight to improve
productivity.

### **Microsoft 365 admins at Microsoft Ignite - <https://aka.ms/Admin10052>**  {#toc-hId--577188080}

Calling all Microsoft 365 admins and IT Pros! This Ignite session
describes the slew of new learning videos that discuss new and recent
improvements to the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft 365 Groups,
and the investments we\'re making in complex organization/multiple
tenant scenarios.

 

### **Improve IT efficiency and agility and stay informed as you enable self-service tasks --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1010**](https://aka.ms/Admin1010) {#toc-hId-1910324753}

Earlier this year, we did a survey to find out how IT departments are
being affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, besides the obvious effect of
organizations shifting to a remote workforce. 2/3 of respondents told us
that their IT budget was decreasing. Yet at the same time, years of
digital transformation are taking place in a timespan of months. Many
organizations also told us that they see an opportunity to consolidate
onto Microsoft products; but it's difficult to find the time to plan
these moves. They told us that their time is split between many things
today: managing their tenant, providing end-user support,
troubleshooting and resolving issues, managing change, and discovering
features.

 

We want to help you spend more time on high value projects. So, we are
building features that increase efficiency across every part of your
admin journey. We're focusing on delegation, speed, and flexibility.

 

In a brand-new video, Karissa Larson, a senior program manager on the
Microsoft 365 admin center team, talks about how you can improve IT
efficiency and agility and maintain visibility through delegation. For
example, you can empower users by enabling features such as self-service
password reset (SSPR). We've been promoting SSPR for a while because we
know it saves time and money for every organization that enables it. In
fact, it can potentially save your organization a lot of time and money.
That's just one form of delegation that makes an admin's life easier.

 

In addition to delegation, we're focused on reducing the amount of time
it takes you to perform every day and not so everyday actions. You told
us that you spend a lot of time in the Microsoft 365 admin center
looking for things instead of doing things. So we built a whole new
search experience that shows you not just new results such as navigation
items in the admin center, but also relevant and recommended
documentation related to your search. Karissa describes the new search
experience and gives a look at what's coming for search by the end of
2020. Karissa also talks about the work we're doing to enable you to
monitor VIP, or priority accounts, and to help you with domain and DNS
records management.

 

Flexibility is all about seamless integration with tools you use today.
Karissa describes integrations that provide you with quick admin access
across Azure, Teams, and Exchange through Microsoft Cloud Shell, the
ability to sync message center posts to Microsoft Planner, and service
incident integration with ServiceNow.

 

I don't want to steal any thunder from Karissa and team, so go watch the
video, which is packed with demos on everything I've mentioned. It also
includes a survey you can fill out to give us feedback and help us
prioritize our work, and a link to register your interest in joining a
virtual roundtable session that will take place in October.

 

### **Making IT more efficient with improvements to Microsoft 365 Groups --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1011**](https://aka.ms/Admin1011) {#toc-hId-102870290}

Karissa's video also includes details on what we're doing to eliminate
the pain of ownerless groups, but we're also doing a lot more with
Groups to make admins more efficient. In case you aren't aware,
[Microsoft 365
Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/office-365-groups)
is a platform and membership service that powers collaboration and
drives teamwork across Microsoft 365. With Groups, you can give a team
of people access to a collection of resources to share, such as a
mailbox, calendar, document library, notebook, and more. The best part
is, you don\'t have to manually assign permissions to each of these
resources because adding people to the group automatically gives them
access.

 

Admins have a variety of controls for managing Groups, but they are
wanting greater efficiency with Groups and visibility into how Groups
are being used.

 

In a brand-new video, Mike McLean and Ramya Rajasekhar, program managers
on the Microsoft 365 Groups team, talk about the many improvements we've
made to Microsoft 365 Groups that span the Microsoft 365 admin center,
Azure Active Directory, Yammer, and more. For example, we've enabled key
scenarios in the admin center, such as the ability to export Groups with
a simple button click, and you can restore deleted Groups and edit Group
email addresses in the admin center. You can also manage ownerless
Groups and Teamify a Group in the admin center, including Groups created
in Outlook.

 

Mike and Ramya discuss the admin experiences for Groups, including new
capabilities around group-driven membership. They describe the
improvements we've made around exporting Group membership from Azure AD,
and how you can now validate dynamic Groups rules. In addition, Groups
can now be assigned roles in Azure AD, allowing you to manage roles at
scale.

 

In the video, Ramya also talks about Groups improvements in Yammer. As
of last month, the All Company community experience in Yammer is now
backed by Groups. All Company is the default community that is created
in Yammer, and it contains all users in the organization. All Company is
now a Microsoft 365 Group, which enables new capabilities, such as
editing the Group name, description, avatar, and so forth. Posts can be
restricted to admins only, and admins can promote others to be admins.
And now you can host Live Events from the All Company community.

 

Finally, the video covers Group Driven Membership (sometimes referred to
as nested groups), which is one of our top requested features. Customers
want to nest security groups in Microsoft 365 groups, and Ramya talks
about a new open source Group Membership Management tool that is now
available to manage nested groups. The tool is based on .NET and uses
Azure functions and Azure table storage, and the Microsoft Graph API as
a data source. We've been using this tool at Microsoft for over a year
where we currently manage more than a hundred of these Groups, some of
which have tens of thousands of members. You can send an
[email](mailto:gmmsupport@service.microsoft.com) to request the tool
from Microsoft.

 

The video includes details on the other Groups improvements for IT
efficiency.

 

### **Role-based access control in Microsoft 365​ --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1008**](https://aka.ms/Admin1008) {#toc-hId--1704584173}

As you may know, Microsoft 365 uses a role-based access control
permissions model.  Referred to as RBAC, it is a conceptual model for
admin permissions in which access is granted by assigning a role to an
object.  This model is used by the various workloads across Microsoft
365.  For example, Exchange Online includes a large set of predefined
roles which you can use to easily grant permissions to admins and users.
Each admin role maps to common business functions and gives people in
your organization permissions to do specific tasks.

 

When it comes to assigning roles and permissions, we have published some
[best practices](https://aka.ms/adminroles). Because admins have access
to sensitive data and files, we recommend that you follow these best
practices to keep your organization\'s data more secure. If you are new
to managing Microsoft 365, be sure to review the most commonly used
Microsoft 365 admin center roles, and if you are working with a
Microsoft partner, be sure to check out the section on delegated
administration.

 

In a brand-new video, Tim Heeney, a Principal Program Manager on the
Amplify team, talks about Microsoft's North Star vision for RBAC in
Microsoft 365, which is based on feedback we've received from admins. 
The vision includes enabling customers to administer with the least
privilege, and to reduce the number of permanent global admins within
the organization.

 

In the video, Tim describes our continuing journey to this North Star,
which includes providing fine-grained delegation of administration, a
single point of management integrated with governance, and a system
designed to intelligently guide you to least privilege use.  As we have
said before, we will continue to add roles to the admin center, and Tim
talks about recently added roles, roles that are coming soon, and custom
roles. He also talks about upcoming integration between the Microsoft
365 admin center and Azure Active Directory Administrative Units.
Administrative Units are a common way to define structure and scope
resources across Microsoft 365 services, and gain clarity into who is
managing what resources.

 

The admin center already supports administrative unit-scoped management
of user properties, passwords, licenses, and administrative unit-scoped
blocking and unblocking of user sign-ins. Tim's video goes into detail
about what's coming next and how you can help prioritize our work in
this area.

Tim also talks about Azure AD Privileged Identity Management integration
that's coming soon to the Microsoft 365 admin center, as well as our
plans for unified role management within the admin center. Finally, Tim
covers the intelligence built into the admin center that compares access
granted with access used and suggests changes that can improve the
security posture of your organization.

 

### **Microsoft 365 admin mobile app: administration on-the-go with productivity with flexibility -** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1009**](https://aka.ms/Admin1009) {#toc-hId-782928660}

Are you an admin who is always on the go?  Even if you aren't, there may
be times when you need to manage Microsoft 365 from your phone or
tablet. That's why there's the free Microsoft 365 admin mobile app, the
perfect companion to the web-based admin center. Our goal is to empower
Microsoft 365 admins of tenants of all sizes to be productive and happy
through mobile experiences.

We've made a lot of improvements to the mobile app, which you can use to
perform more than 90 tasks to help you manage Microsoft 365. You can
customize your dashboard and get the information you need to maintain
service quality for your users delivered directly to your device. You
can manage users, groups, and passwords, and create service requests.
You can unblock users and protect sensitive data with on-the-go access
to common tasks such as adding users, resetting passwords, removing
company data, assigning product licenses, and more. And now, you can
even view Intune-enrolled mobile devices, view billing related alerts,
and report incidents.

 

And if you\'re responsible for more than one tenant, you can sign into
multiple tenants and quickly switch between them. The app isn't just
mobile; it's also global. It supports all 39 languages that are
supported by the Microsoft 365 admin center.

 

In a brand-new video, Harish Kumar Agarwal, Senior Program Manager at
Microsoft, talks about the latest innovations in the Microsoft 365 admin
mobile app, including support for Intune's mobile application management
and conditional access policies, and notifications related to service
health, message center posts, and billing notices.

 

Harish describes our focus on three areas:

1.  Start the day tasks, which include views of key aspects of your
    tenant to help you plan your day ahead;
2.  Save the day tasks, which enable you to perform urgent actions that
    address blocked productivity or security risks; and
3.  Notifications to help you stay informed about information and events
    across your tenant and organization.

Harish explains why we're investing in mobile admin scenarios, and he
demos several "start the day" and "save the day" tasks.

 

Finally, Harish gives you a glimpse into the roadmap for the Microsoft
365 admin mobile app, including work items currently under development,
and items under consideration. Be sure to check out the video, as it
provides details on how you can share your input with the team and help
us prioritize our roadmap.

 

### **Drive external collaboration for your organization using Microsoft 365 Groups --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1007**](https://aka.ms/Admin1007) {#toc-hId--1024525803}

Guest access for Microsoft 365 Groups is enabled for all tenants by
default. As an admin, you can control whether to allow guest access to
groups for your entire organization or a selective subset. When enabled,
group members can invite guest users to a Microsoft 365 group.
Invitations are sent to the group owner for approval, and once approved,
the guest user is added to the directory and the group. Guest access in
groups is often used as part of a broader scenario that includes
SharePoint or Teams, and those services have their own guest sharing
settings.

 

Within Microsoft 365, we see millions of guests have been provisioned
through Microsoft 365 Groups. And we know that the need for
cross-organization collaboration is increasing. But it can be a bit of a
challenge for admins to achieve the right balance between preventing
unauthorized access and allowing unfettered collaboration. But there are
several benefits to be gained by enabling guest access. For example,
guest access enables safe teamwork outside your organization's firewall.
It works with any email address, and it's based on the Azure B2B
platform.

 

In a brand-new video, Salil Kakkar and Nandini Bhavasar, program
managers on the Microsoft 365 Groups team, provide Microsoft's latest
guidance on enabling guess access for external collaboration, managing
the lifecycle of external collaboration, and best practices for managing
guest access at scale. They discuss the benefits of enabling guest
access and how to enable guest it, as well as our best practices for
governing guest access, including best practices around granting
permissions and restricting domains.

 

Salil and Nandini show you how to track guest user activity using audit
logs and guest access reviews, and how to use guest policies effectively
in your organization. They walk you through the process of entitlement
management, where guests can be automatically invited after being
approved, provisioned with time-limited access across Groups, Teams,
sites, and apps, and automatically removed when access is no longer
needed.  They also talk about the guest lifecycle and adoption.

Finally, the video also briefly covers how we manage guest access here
at Microsoft. Be sure to check out this video and start enabling safe
and secure guest access for your organization.

 

### **Leveraging user feedback about Microsoft 365 in your organization --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1015**](https://aka.ms/Admin1015) {#toc-hId-1462987030}

Did you know that you can directly influence change at Microsoft by
providing feedback and by participating in our surveys and other
connection points? We have built several collection and response
experiences, including the ability to collect ad hoc feedback, as well
as systems that enable user-initiated feedback and system-initiated user
feedback. We also have send-a-smile, which allows you to tell us if you
like something, or if you don't.

 

Each month we collect \~5 million feedback signals through these main
systems, and another \~7 million feedback signals through support,
forums, and other feedback channels. While we can\'t respond to every
suggestion, we are committed to reading everything.

 

Microsoft 365 admins have also given us feedback on feedback. You've
told us that you want visibility into and transparency around the
feedback provided to us by your users, and that you want to use feedback
to gain insight into product satisfaction within your organization.
You've let us know that you want to leverage user feedback to understand
and improve the health of your organization.

 

In a brand-new video, Reshma Kapoor, a Senior Program Manager on the
Release and Delivery Experiences team, provides details on the
investments we are making around customer feedback in Microsoft 365 that
provide admins with more control: control over the feedback process,
control over feedback data, and control over communications within their
tenant. Reshma also talks about work we are doing to enable admins to
view data, status, and insights from feedback, and what admins can to do
take action on feedback provided by their users.

 

Finally, Reshma describes the private preview that is launching in late
2020 where customers can co-build feedback controls and systems directly
with Microsoft.  This will initially start as a small program, with
perhaps 20-30 customers, so go watch the recording, and follow the
instructions to indicate your interest in the preview program.

## Next Steps {#toc-hId-1452483926}

Now that we've covered how you can increase IT efficiency and agility by
enabling self-service, leveraging the improvements in the Microsoft 365
admin center and Microsoft 365 Groups, and by using feedback within your
organization to measure and manage health, check out the great content
we have for Modern Cloud Management and Investments in Complex
Organizations.

 

Here's the complete list of available videos and their URLs. We hope you
enjoy them!
