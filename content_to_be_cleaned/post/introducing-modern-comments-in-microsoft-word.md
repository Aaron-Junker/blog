Workplace collaboration is evolving---and so is Microsoft Word. Today,
we\'re pleased to announce **expanded availability of our new modern
commenting experience across Word platforms**. 

 

Modern comments sets the stage for a richer Word collaboration
experience for you and your teams by enabling modern features such as
\@mention notifications and more. It aligns how comments work across
Office on different endpoints, so that you and your team can rely on a
consistent experience regardless of whether you're using Word, Excel, or
PowerPoint on any platform.

 

Modern comments was first introduced on the mobile and Web versions of
Word where we iterated based on feedback.  Now it is rolling out to
Production on Word for Windows and MacOS!

Here\'s a look at what to expect:

 

**Stay in control **

With modern comments, you no longer have to worry about your comments
being seen by others before you're finished editing them. After you
draft a new comment or reply, click the **Post** button or use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (MacOS) to share
your thoughts with others.   Now, a comment or reply can only be edited
by the person who created it. 

 

[![Click the Post button to share your
comments](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/271420i0A1E5954034E3F76/image-size/medium?v=v2&px=400 "reply.gif"){.lia-media-image

onclick="event.preventDefault();"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-center
image-alt="Click the Post button to share your comments"
style="width: 400px;"}

**Flexibility in how you view and interact with comments **

In Word you\'ll find comments to the right of your page, by default. In
this view, contextual comments are side-by-side with the page content,
to help you focus on the feedback that's most relevant to the part of
the document you're working on.  

In the Comments pane, you can see a single list of all comments in your
document, including resolved comments.  To switch between the contextual
view and the Comments pane, simply click the Comments button in the
upper right corner of your Word window. 

 

[![Switch between contextual view and the Comments
pane](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/271419i466847784FA30622/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "pane.gif"){.lia-media-image

.lia-image-align-center
image-alt="Switch between contextual view and the Comments pane"
style="width: 999px;"}

**Resolve comment threads **

Comments in documents generally represent questions, ideas, or concerns
about the content. When those have been addressed, comments allow you to
mark that thread as resolved. Resolved comment threads won\'t appear in
the contextual view (though you can still find them in the Comments
pane) to help you stay focused on what's active.

.lia-image-align-center image-alt="Resolve comment threads"
style="width: 400px;"}

**Improved** **\@mentions in comments**

Users have been adding names to comments for years. Now, if you're an
enterprise user working on cloud files, you can more easily use an
\@mention to call out to one or more of your colleagues in your
organization or school.  Just highlight some text, click the Comment
button, type your comment, and \@mention anyone you want to see it.

 

When you post your comment, anybody that you\'ve \@mentioned in it will
get an email notification. Whoever started the comment thread will also
be notified. Notification emails let your collaborators know there's
been new activity in the comment thread, gives them a preview of the
document content where the comment was made, as well as the comment you
left. They can reply to your comment from the email, or they can click a
link in the notification email to open the document and go straight to
the comment if they want to see more context. 

 

**Better collaboration practices for today\'s remote world**

These new commenting experiences are ideal for today\'s remote teams who
may be working together from across town or around the world.  Comments
eliminate the need to coordinate schedules or conduct in-person
discussions, providing greater flexibility and enabling collaborators to
provide better insights.  A consistent experience across applications
makes everything flow smoothly.

 

## **What we have heard**  {#toc-hId--494701842}

 

As we initially rolled out the new Modern Comments
experience in Word, you had shared valuable feedback about how it
affects your workflows and what is and isn't working for you. Your
feedback enables us to improve the experience for all users.  

 

Here's some of what we heard: 

-   Concern that comments created with modern comments are not backwards
    compatible --*** We want to ensure you are aware that any comment
    created with Modern comments can be consumed and interacted with by
    users on earlier or non-Microsoft 365 versions of Word and vice
    versa.*** 
-   Reduced efficiency in working with comments, particularly in posting
    or editing comments  
-   Not all formatting was supported in comments, such as font color 
-   Not all content was supported in comments, such as images 
-   Autocorrect was not supported, including custom autocorrect
    shortcuts used to save time 
-   Comments and tracked changes layout takes up screen real estate and
    pushes comments further from the page 
-   Grammar checking is not available in comments  
-   It is more challenging to see where comments are connected to,
    without the dotted lines

about the current ability for Modern comments to support more complex
workflows and have made the following additional
change. ]{contrast="none"}[ ]{ccp-props="{\"134233117\":true,\"134233118\":true,\"201341983\":0,\"335559740\":240}"}

-   **[Opt-out]{contrast="none"}**[: we have added support for a new
    opt-out toggle in Word's Options dialog. This will allow users to
    temporarily revert the comments experience to our legacy comments
    model while we continue to iterate on the new experience and listen
    to customer feedback ]{contrast="none"}([see the FAQ link below for
    more details).]{contrast="none"}

These changes have been released with the [October
]{contrast="none"}2021 monthly update and are in the process of rolling
out to all customers with modern comments. Some users will not have
these changes available immediately until the roll out process is
complete (for instance you might see modern comments are available but
the Quick Edit button is not yet visible).
