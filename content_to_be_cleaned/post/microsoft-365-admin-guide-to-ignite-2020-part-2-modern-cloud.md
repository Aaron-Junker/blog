[Microsoft Ignite](https://myignite.microsoft.com/home), our yearly
flagship event for Microsoft products and technologies, is a 48-hour
digital event experience taking place from September 22-24,
2020. Ignite, of course, is a very different event this year. On the one
hand, it is a single global event where everyone gets the same news,
information, content, and experience at the same time. But on the other
hand, I will miss the many personal connections that take place at our
in-person events. I look forward to the day when in-person events
resume, but until then, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share
with you now an amazing collection of video content covering the
incredible work being done across Microsoft 365.

 

Last year, the [[admin track at
Ignite](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/the-microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2019/ba-p/953950)]{.underline}
had several breakout, theater, and learning path sessions from a variety
of engineering teams, including:

-   the Microsoft 365 admin center team---the team that builds the
    Microsoft 365 admin center and admin mobile app;
-   Release and Delivery Experiences---the team that builds, among other
    things, Office.com and Office What's New;
-   Microsoft 365 Groups---the team that builds the Microsoft 365 Groups
    platform, membership service, and user experiences; and
-   Microsoft 365 Complex Orgs---the team that builds features and
    experiences to support customer mergers, acquisitions, and
    divestitures, and cross-tenant collaboration.

Since last Ignite, each of these teams has been immersed in customer
feedback and working hard to deliver your most-wanted admin experiences.
At an in-person Ignite, they'd be up on stage telling you all about what
they've been up to for the past year. But since we can't do that, I am
thrilled to announce that we've done the next best thing -- a digital
admin track!

 

The Microsoft 365 Admin Tools and Experiences track has a slew of new
videos that announce new features and ways to connect with Microsoft 365
engineering teams. These videos detail the new features and experiences
we have delivered and are delivering to you. They talk about what we've
done over the past year and why we've done it, and they give you a
glimpse into what we're doing next and why. Watch these videos not just
for the content, but also for the opportunities they give you to engage
directly with these feature teams and register your interest for
upcoming previews, roundtables, and other product team engagements.

 

There are 18 across three broad themes:

-   [IT efficiency and
    agility](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2020-part-1-it-efficiency/ba-p/1661053 "IT efficiency and agility");
-   Modern cloud management; and
-   [Investments in complex
    organizations](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2020-part-3-investments-in/ba-p/1669547 "Investments in complex organizations")

This post covers Modern Cloud Management. Prior to the pandemic, the
modern workplace was already evolving at lightning speed, with
distributed teams, brand-new business models, and complex security
issues. It's undergoing transition---a digital transformation, if you
will---where your organization, your users, and your customers are more
connected and mobile than ever. Successfully navigating this digital
transformation is likely one of your highest priorities.

 

Modern cloud management embraces your users' needs and the changing
environment. Modern cloud management is the foundation of the modern
workplace, and by adopting new approaches to IT management, including
cloud technologies, you can simplify management, improve security, and
provide better user experiences while lowering TCO.

### **Microsoft 365 admins at Microsoft Ignite - <https://aka.ms/Admin10052>**  {#toc-hId-1910567796}

Calling all Microsoft 365 admins and IT Pros! This Ignite session
describes the slew of new learning videos that discuss new and recent
improvements to the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft 365 Groups,
and the investments we\'re making in complex organization/multiple
tenant scenarios.

### **Managing Remote Work with Microsoft 365 --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin3010**](https://aka.ms/Admin3010) {#toc-hId--1704341130}

Like Microsoft, organizations around the world are putting the safety of
their employees, customers and communities first.  In fact, we've all
had to adjust to a new remote world this year.

Even as things settle down, a degree of remote work will remain. In
time, as employees begin to return to the workplace, remote security,
productivity, and management will continue to be a primary focus.
Working remotely can push the boundaries of security, and the stakes are
incredibly high for organizations working through today's new remote
reality that includes remote buying and selling, remote learning,
telemedicine, remote teamwork and development, and remote management.

 

Enabling remote work raises some important questions, such as:

-   How can we work better remotely?
-   How can we maintain security?
-   And how can we simplify operations?

 

These questions can be particularly difficult to answer for small and
medium-sized businesses. In a brand-new video, Paty Carlos and Ishaan
Agarwal, program managers on the Amplify team, help you answer those
questions about how to run your small or medium business remotely.

 

Paty and Ishaan start with details on how to setup and manage Microsoft
Teams using the Microsoft 365 admin center, including Microsoft 365
Business Voice. Next, they walk you through how to configure policies
for Teams in the Teams admin center using policy packages. A policy
package is a collection of predefined policies and settings that can be
customized and applied to a group of users that have similar roles
within your organization. You'll see how to use an app setup policy that
includes the apps for a business voice experience for users.

 

They also show you how you can enable additional security for remote
work in the Microsoft 365 admin center, including a new Remote Work
Essentials page that is coming soon. You can use this single page to set
up all the recommended essential remote work features. The page includes
a collection of actions you can take to help your organization stay
safe, secure, and productive, such as protecting your organization using
security defaults, or enabling self-service password reset, or
protecting data in mobile apps.

 

Finally, Paty and Ishaan will show you how to simplify your operations
by doing things like promoting OneDrive, Teams and Office use through
recommendations and Microsoft curated content.

This video is packed with demos and ways for small and medium businesses
to modernize cloud management, so be sure to check it out.

 

### **Transform change management by syncing Message Center posts to Planner --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1019**](https://aka.ms/Admin1019) {#toc-hId-783171703}

The Message Center in the Microsoft 365 admin center is designed to help
you keep track of upcoming changes to Microsoft 365, including new and
changed features, planned maintenance, and other important
announcements. Each post provides you with a high-level overview of
planned changes along with links to detailed information to help you
prepare for and manage the change. Organizations typically see an
average of 140 messages per month.

 

Customers have given us feedback on the challenges they face with the
Message Center. You've told us that:

-   It's not easy to triage message center posts; and
-   There's no way to assign posts for action and accountability; and
-   That you spend your time managing content, instead of change.

To help you navigate the myriad of information that arrives in the
Message Center, to help you decide whether or not to act on that
information, and to help you manage change and not content, we've
introduced the ability to sync Message Center posts to Microsoft
Planner.

 

In a brand-new video, Paolo Ciccu, a program manager on the Release and
Delivery Experiences team, talks about this new feature and how to use
it to manage change instead of content. Paolo also provides tips and
tricks for maximizing the use of this new feature that came directly
from customers in the preview program.

 

Paolo starts by discussing the feedback we heard from customers, and the
challenges they face.  He then describes our solution---the ability to
sync Message Center to Planner, as well as why we chose to use Planner
as our change management platform. He also talks about the particular
challenges around change management and provides Microsoft's best
practices for change management in Microsoft 365.

 

Paolo also demonstrates how to setup the Planner sync feature, how it
works, and how to configure and organize Planner to meet your needs.

 

Finally, Paolo details how you can connect with the feature team for
deeper interaction and for providing feedback. We'd love to hear
directly from you on how we can enhance and improve this feature, not
just to meet your needs, but to make your life easier.

 

### **Effective controls for Microsoft 365 Apps in the Microsoft 365 admin center -- <https://aka.ms/Admin1120>** {#toc-hId--1024282760}

Microsoft's vision when it comes to helping you deploy and manage
Microsoft 365 Apps, is to empower admins to make informed decisions. We
want to help accelerate your modernization, build your confidence and
trust, and increase your satisfaction and productivity.  Earlier this
year, we released Office What's New Management in the Microsoft 365
admin center and the Office 365 Client Configuration Service
(config.office.com) that allows admins to choose which new features are
shown to or hidden from end users in the Help area of the Office desktop
apps.

 

Next is channel management for Microsoft 365 Apps. That means choosing
the right update channel that best fits the needs of your organization.
You can control how often users in your organization get updates to
Microsoft 365 Apps by specifying which update channel to use.  There are
three primary update channels: Current, Monthly Enterprise, and
Semi-Annual Enterprise.

 

Generally, we recommend the Current Channel, especially for small and
medium businesses and education customers, because it provides your
users with the newest Office features as soon as they are ready.  If you
want predictability of when the features are available to your users, we
recommend the new Monthly Enterprise Channel. In cases where you require
extensive testing before deploying new features, we recommend the
Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel.

 

In a brand-new recording, Patrice Mélékian, Principal Program Manager on
the Release and Delivery Experiences teams, describe Microsoft's vision
for deploying and managing Microsoft 365 apps. He talks about channel
management, and how to choose the right channel for your organization.
He also describes the new Monthly Enterprise Channel and the new
installation option controls that allow you to roll back to your
previous version of Office or skip an upcoming update to the next
version.

Patrice talks about the Office What's New Management feature and how to
manage new feature communication and end-user education for your
organization, as well as the Office What's New management card you can
add to the home page of the Microsoft 365 admin center. In case you
haven't seen it, we added release dates to the card to ensure that you
have visibility into when each version is released across all channels.

 

Be sure to check out this video for all this great stuff, as well as
opportunities to directly engage with the team by email and to join a
customer panel.

 

### **New admin capabilities to modernizing servicing of the Office client --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1016**](https://aka.ms/Admin1016) {#toc-hId-1463230073}

One of the benefits of cloud-based software is that users always have
the latest version. But we know for software that is deployed to
clients, such as Microsoft 365 Apps, a lot of organizations struggle to
keep their Office clients up to date.  Many are unable to update within
30 days of release.

When it comes to Microsoft 365 apps, customers have told us that they
want the ability to easily stay current, that they want to reduce the
burden on admins, and that they don't want on-premises infrastructure to
be required for deployment.

 

Microsoft's vision for enterprise health with respect to the deployment
and management of Microsoft 365 Apps is to provide admins with
intelligent insights and controls, predictable and automated servicing,
and optimal app health and performance.

 

In a brand-new video, Amesh Mansukhani, a principal program manager on
the Office Engineering team, provides details on that vision.  Amesh
talks about the challenges around staying current, as well as the
reasons for staying current. He also describes the fundamentals of our
update experience, which include delivery optimization, network
optimization, and experiences that minimize disruptions.

 

Amesh also describes the intelligent insights and controls we are
delivering, such as Office inventory, which allows you to drill into
detailed views of Device and Add-in information. He also debuts a new
dashboard showing your organization's security update status across all
app update channels.

Amesh then talks about how we're delivering predictable and automated
servicing. This includes the new Office Apps Servicing Profile, which
automatically delivers updates based on your needs.

 

Finally, Amesh describes the new insights and alerting we are delivering
that provide Office app health at a glance.

 

Each of these new features will enter public preview starting next
month, so be sure to check out the video to get the details on these new
features and the previews.

 

### **Microsoft 365 Groups overview and architecture deep dive --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1017**](https://aka.ms/Admin1017) {#toc-hId--344224390}

Microsoft 365 Groups is the membership service that powers collaboration
across Microsoft 365. There are more than 20 Office apps that leverage
groups inside their experiences for capabilities such as sharing, and
there is a thriving partner ecosystem with apps that provide additional
governance tools on top of what we provide. Easily the most common
question we get from customers is how does the Group creation and
provisioning process work. A related and often asked question is why do
we see Outlook Groups in Teams but not in Yammer?

 

In a brand-new video, Arunkumaran Varadharajan, a Principal PM Manager
on the Microsoft 365 Groups team, answers these common questions and
more. Arun provides an overview of Groups, and dives deep into the
internal architecture of Groups in both the enterprise and consumer
spaces. Next, he covers the Group creation and provisioning process to
help you better understand what happens when you create a Group in, say
for example, Outlook, versus Teams or Yammer.  Arun walks through the
lifecycle and flow for Groups, including creation and naming policies,
using sensitivity labels with Groups, and data residency considerations.

 

Arun then discusses Group activity tracking, Group deletion, and deleted
Group restoration and retention, as well as the differences between
soft-delete and hard-delete.  Next, Arun shares what happens when
someone joins a Group from both inside and outside your organization.
Finally, Arun discusses Groups governance, including both app-specific
policies across Exchange, Teams, and SharePoint, and tenant-wide
policies, such as naming, creation, and expiry, and security and
compliance across the suite.

 

### **Governance and management best practices for Microsoft 365 Groups --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1018**](https://aka.ms/Admin1018) {#toc-hId-2143288443}

Microsoft 365 Groups include a variety of governance controls to help
you manage Groups in your organization, including as I mentioned,
expiration policies, naming conventions, blocked words policies, and
self-service capabilities.

 

Groups can be created by users from a variety of endpoints, such as
Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint. You can control who can create groups
but be aware that limiting group creation can hinder productivity
because many Microsoft 365 services require Groups to function. Other
governance options include limiting group creation to members of a
dynamic security group containing, for example, all full-time employees.
In this scenario, you may also want to consider requiring users to
complete training on your organization's policies for Groups before they
can become members of the security group.

 

To limit group sprawl, you can use expiration policies to automatically
delete groups that are not being used. You can specify an expiration
period begins when the group is created, or on the date it was last
renewed, and any group that reaches the end of that period, and is not
renewed, will be deleted. Note that any group that is deleted can be
restored within 30 days by the group owners or an admin.

 

In a brand-new video, Vinay Jagannatha Rao, a program manager on the
Microsoft 365 Groups team, provides Microsoft's recommended guidance and
best practices for managing and governing the Groups lifecycle. In it,
Vinay talks about a variety of governance tools and our latest best
practices.

Support for sensitivity labels on Groups, which we announced at Ignite
last year, is now generally available, and Vinay talks about the
benefits of using labels on Groups and how it can help you protect high
value information. Vinay also provides guidance for migrating any
existing Azure Information Protection labels to sensitivity labels, and
details how to restrict who can create public or external groups.

 

Next, Vinay talks about support for Information Barriers that allow you
to create ethical walls and block communication and collaboration as
needed to prevent any conflicts of interest within your organization.
Vinay also talks about a survey we are conducting around your
information barrier needs.

 

Vinay provides a sneak peek at Ownership Governance, a new feature in
development and expected in early 2021, and he shows you how you can
sign up for the preview program.

 

If you are wondering how to effectively govern groups, or how to manage
groups at scale, or whether you should enable groups self-service, this
video is for you!

 

### **Microsoft 365 Groups roadmap updates --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1013**](https://aka.ms/Admin1013) {#toc-hId--359329499}

Last year at [Ignite 2019](https://youtu.be/dAamBF1gb7M) and on the
Ignite Tour, we spoke about the Office 365 Groups platform and how it
powered collaboration across Microsoft 365. We showed you how Groups can
help you share knowledge and information using email, calendaring,
documents, among other things. We described the Groups lifecycle that
moves from exploration to pilot and from pilot to a controlled rollout.
We explained how to deploy groups at scale, how to empower end users,
and how to control who can create Groups.

 

Finally, we talked about the roadmap for Groups. We provided a progress
report over where we were since Ignite 2018, and we described how
upcoming investments would help you drive new levels of collaboration.
Since we were covering roughly a year's worth of work, we discussed a
lot of innovation that had taken place between 2018 and 2019. The
session was packed with demos and information, which is why it was one
of only five sessions in the admin track on the Ignite tour.

 

Well buckle up because it's back again this year!  And with a new name!
To reflect the fact that Office 365 Groups power collaboration across
Microsoft 365, Office 365 Groups became Microsoft 365 Groups.

 

And in a brand-new recording covering Groups roadmap updates, Venkat
Ayyadevara and Mike McLean, program managers on the Groups team, provide
the team's yearly roadmap update that includes various usage metrics,
and details on the evolution of the Groups platform, which now crosses
work and life.

 

Once again, it's been a busy year for Microsoft 365 Groups. In addition
to rebranding, Venkat and Mike recap their roadmap update from Ignite
2019, and then they cover the abundance of Groups innovations we've made
since then across three areas: governance, management at scale, and work
and life. These improvements include general availability of support for
sensitivity labels, Microsoft 365 admin center support for exporting
groups, managing Group email addresses, support for application
authentication in Microsoft Graph, and support for Teams for personal
use, to name a few.

 

As always, Venkat and Mike's roadmap update is packed with information
and demos, so be sure to check it out, and give us your input and
feedback on how we're doing. Do you like what we've done since last
year? Do you like where we're headed with Groups? Watch the video and
let us know what you think.

 

### **Managing work and life with Microsoft 365 Groups --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1022**](https://aka.ms/Admin1022) {#toc-hId-2128183334}

If this year has done anything, it's blurred the lines between work and
life like never before. We've now reached an inflection point. As the
global response to COVID-19 evolves, communities around the world have
moved from an era of "remote everything" into a more hybrid model of
work, learning, and life. We've always known that technology isn\'t only
for work. Technology can help you stay connected to friends and family
even when you\'re apart. It can help you make the most of your time so
you can focus on what matters. You can't create more hours in the day,
but you can make the most of your time.

 

In a brand-new video, Sandra Vargas and Rahul Rai, program managers on
the Microsoft 365 Groups team, explain our vision for a unified Groups
platform across Microsoft 365 for enterprises, businesses, family, and
home. For Enterprises, Microsoft 365 Groups is a true membership service
built on Azure Active Directory that powers all teamwork scenarios in
Microsoft 365. In the consumer world, Groups is an identity and
membership service built on top of the Microsoft Account experience
(MSA) that aims to powers all Group scenarios in Microsoft consumer
apps, like Outlook.com. So just like in the enterprise world, on the
consumer side, Microsoft 365 Groups power intelligent apps that bring
together groups of people with the resources they need to achieve
amazing outcomes. These Groups can be used by families, social and
professional groups, and self-directed workers, such as contractors.

 

In the video, Sandra and Rahul explain why we have extended the Groups
platform, and how this extension can help you find new balance in this
blending of work and life.  They'll introduce you to Alex, a persona we
created to illustrate the new normal.  Alex is the IT admin for Contoso.
She's also a wife and the mother of 2 children. As the admin at work,
Alex uses the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage features such as
Groups and Teams. She also uses Outlook, Teams, and Groups extensively.
Alex is also the IT admin at home where she manages her family's
devices, apps, and calendar.

 

With COVID restrictions in place, both Alex and her husband Mark have
been working from home and with all the overlapping meetings, they
finally decide that they need another home office. To help manage this
project, they decide to use Microsoft 365 Groups, which allows them to
coordinate tasks and schedules across their family, and the contractors
involved in the project.

 

Check out the video and see for yourself how Groups can help you with
work and life, providing whole day experiences that make your life
easier.

 

### **How Microsoft manages Microsoft 365 Groups for its employees --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1003**](https://aka.ms/Admin1003) {#toc-hId-320728871}

Microsoft Core Services Engineering and Operations, or CSEO, formerly
Microsoft IT, began embracing digital transformation and the culture
changes that go with it a few years ago. CSEO is very much a global IT
organization, with a significant amount of data, people, services, and
devices to manage. Their vision for seamless teamwork is to use
Microsoft 365 to create productive and aligned teams, and to engage
employees with leadership and the company.

 

Today, nearly all our IT infrastructure is in the cloud using Azure as
our primary platform, and Microsoft 365 as our platform for
productivity. Microsoft's IT environment is quite expansive, with nearly
9 petabytes of data being managed across more than 100 countries, and
dozens of cloud services.  We have hundreds of thousands of users,
guests, mailboxes, sites, and teams, along with thousands of Yammer
communities. And we have more than 350,000 Microsoft 365 Groups.

 

One of CSEO's guiding principles is to enable employee self-service
throughout the company. For example, any full-time employee at Microsoft
can create a Microsoft 365 Group. We know firsthand that by enabling
self-service we are:

-   Reducing IT overhead;
-   Discouraging shadow IT; and
-   Discouraging large groups, which can sometimes lead to oversharing.

In a brand-new video, David Johnson, a Principal Program Manager on the
CSEO team, talks about how Microsoft manages Microsoft 365 Groups for
its employees. David provides answers to the questions we get around how
we empower employees, enable collaboration, and manage data. David talks
about how CSEO decided to invest on container ownership, which is
critical in a self-service environment, and content identification,
which enables Microsoft to protect content and reduce the chances of
oversharing.

 

David talks about Microsoft's principles of container and content
governance, which involve several important focus points to help ensure
that Microsoft data is safe and secure. He also talks about group driven
membership at Microsoft, as well as the Group Membership Management tool
I mentioned earlier.  David also talks about the custom solutions CSEO
developed to protect assets and ensure employee accountability.

 

David's video helps to assuage the fears often held by IT around data
protection and compliance, perceived chaos and sprawl resulting from
employee empowerment, content overexposure or oversharing, and employees
introducing shadow IT, so be sure to check it out.
