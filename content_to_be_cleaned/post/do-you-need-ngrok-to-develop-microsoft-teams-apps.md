style="width: 400px;"}If you\'ve started down the path of developing
applications for Microsoft Teams, you may have seen a tool
called [ngrok](https://www.ngrok.com/) as a prerequisite in various
tutorials and lab exercises. It\'s also integrated with a number of
tools such as the [Microsoft Teams
Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) and
the [yo
teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tutorials/get-started-yeoman?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) generator;
even the [Bot Framework
Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) has
an ngrok option.

This article will explain what ngrok is, why it\'s useful, and what to
do instead if you or your company are uncomfortable using it. Also,
please check out the companion video for this article, which includes
live demos of Teams development with and without ngrok.

First the shocking truth: Microsoft Teams applications don\'t run in
Teams. OK maybe it\'s not shocking, but it\'s true. Teams applications
are made up of regular web pages and web services that you can host
anywhere on the Internet. Teams tabs and task modules (dialog boxes) are
just embedded web pages; bots and messaging extensions are web services.
This allows developers to use their choice of web development stack, and
to reuse code and skills.

Web developers typically host a small web server on the same computer
where they edit their code to run and debug their applications. For
Microsoft Teams developers in particular, ngrok is very handy in this
situation. Here\'s why:

1.  ngrok provides the encryption needed for https, which is required
    for Teams applications. It\'s set up using a trusted TLS certificate
    so it just works immediately in any web browser.

2.  ngrok provides a tunnel from the Internet to your local computer
    which can accept incoming requests that are normally blocked by an
    Internet firewall. The requests in this case are HTTP POSTs that
    come from the Azure Bot Service. Though tunneling is not required
    per se, there has to be some way for the Azure Bot Service to send
    requests to the application.

3.  ngrok provides name resolution with a DNS names ending
    in `ngrok.io`, so it\'s easy to find the public side of the Internet
    tunnel.

4.  ngrok makes mobile device testing easier since any
    Internet-connected phone or tablet can reach your app via the
    tunnel. There\'s no need to mess with the the phone\'s network
    connections; it just works.

These conveniences have made ngrok the darling of many Microsoft Teams
developers. It lets them compile, run, and debug software locally
without worrying about any of these details.

The tunneling part, however, lacks the guard rails expected by many IT
professionals, especially if they\'re managing a traditional corporate
network that relies on a shared firewall or proxy server for security.
While ngrok only provides access to the local computer where it\'s run,
an insider \"bad actor\" could launch attacks from such a machine. For
that reason, some IT departments block all access to ngrok.

> Many colleagues have suggested other tunneling applications such
> as [Azure
> Relay](https://blog.botframework.com/2019/04/16/debugging-your-locally-hosted-v4-bot-using-azure-relays/) or [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/).
> While they may do the job, they still open a tunnel from the public
> Internet to your development computer, and thus the same security

Most computers that are connected to the Internet aren\'t connected
directly. Network traffic passes through some kind of firewall or NAT
router to reach the actual Internet. The firewall allows outgoing
requests to servers on the Internet but blocks all incoming requests.
This is largely a security measure, but it has other advantages as well.

A typical web developer runs some kind of web server on their local
computer. They can access that web server using the
hostname `localhost`, which routes messages through a \"loopback\"
service instead of sending them out on the network. As you can see in
the picture, these messages don\'t go through the Internet at all.

But what if, in order to test the application, it needs to get requests
from the Internet? Bots are an example of this; the requests come from
the Azure Bot service in the cloud, not from a local web browser or
other client program. Another place this comes up is when implementing
webhooks such as [Microsoft Graph change
notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/webhooks?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman);
the notifications are HTTP(s) requests that come from the Internet.

The problem is these incoming requests are normally blocked by the
firewall. If you\'ve ever opened a port on your home router to allow a
gadget to receive incoming connections, this is the same situation.

With ngrok running, the incoming requests go through the ngrok service
and into your locally running copy of the ngrok application. The ngrok
application calls the local server, allowing the developer to run and
debug the web server locally.

In the case of Teams development, tabs and task modules only require a
local loopback connection, whereas bots and messaging extensions have to
handle incoming requests from the Internet. Each is explained in more
detail later in this article.

## [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#using-ngrok){#user-content-using-ngrok .anchor}Using ngrok {#toc-hId-213062875}

ngrok is a command line program that works on [Windows, Mac OS, Linux
and FreeBSD](https://ngrok.com/download).

Suppose your local web server is
at [http://localhost:3978](http://localhost:3978/) (the default for
bots). Then run this ngrok command line:

::: {.highlight .highlight-source-shell .position-relative}
    ngrok http 3978
:::

You will then see a screen like this:

.lia-image-align-inline image-alt="ngrok-screenshot.png"
style="width: 972px;"}

The \"Forwarding\" lines show what\'s happening. Requests arriving at
http://(something).ngrok.io or https://(something).ngrok.io will be
forwarded to [http://localhost:3978](http://localhost:3978/) where your
bot code is running. At this point you would put the
\"something.ngrok.io\" address into your Azure bot configuration, Teams
app manifest etc. as the location, and leave the command running while
you debug your application.

### [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#ngrok-url){#user-content-ngrok-url .anchor}ngrok url {#toc-hId-903624349}

The external ngrok url will always look like this:

::: {.snippet-clipboard-content .position-relative}
    https://(something).ngrok.io
:::

With the free ngrok service, the value of (something) is different every
time you run ngrok, and you\'re limited to an 8-hour session. Every time
you get a new hostname you need to update your configuration; depending
on what you\'re doing and how many places you had to enter the hostname,
this can be a chore. The paid plans allow you to reserve names that will
persist, so you can just start ngrok and and you\'re ready to go.

> Hint: If you\'re doing a tutorial using the free version of ngrok,
> make a note of every place you use the ngrok URL. That way you can
> easily remember where to update it when it changes.

The example above assumes that your local server is running http on the
specified port. If your local server is running https you need a
different command or it won\'t connect:

::: {.highlight .highlight-source-shell .position-relative}
    ngrok http https://localhost:3978
:::

### [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#host-header-rewriting){#user-content-host-header-rewriting .anchor}Host header rewriting {#toc-hId--903830114}

The HTTP(s) protocol includes a header called `Host`, which should
contain the host (domain) name and port of the web server. This is used
for routing requests to the right server, and for allowing a single web
server to serve multiple web sites and services.

If your debug server ignores the host header, you can ignore this
section. But some servers will require the header to match the host
name, such as `localhost:3978`. The challenge is that if the request was
sent to `12345.ngrok.io`, the originator will probably put that in the
host header when the server is expecting `localhost:3978`. To handle
this, ngrok provides a command line argument that replaces the host
headers with the local host name. Simply add the `-host-header` command
switch to enable this.

For example,

::: {.highlight .highlight-source-shell .position-relative}
    ngrok http -host-header=localhost:3978 3978
:::

If you see the messages go through to your local web server but it
doesn\'t respond, it may be expecting a specific host header.

All the command options are detailed in the [ngrok
documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs).

### [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#network-tracing){#user-content-network-tracing .anchor}Network tracing {#toc-hId-1583682719}

You might notice that the ngrok screen shows a trace of requests that
went through the tunnel; in this case they\'re HTTP POST requests from
the Azure Bot Service, and the local server returned a 200 (OK)
response. This is handy because you can see a 500 error from your server
code by just glancing at the ngrok screen.

You might also notice the \"Web interface\" url on the ngrok screen. It
provides a full network trace of what went through the tunnel, which can
be very helpful in debugging.

Some Teams application features are based on web pages provided by your
application:

-   Tabs and Tab Configuration Pages
-   Task Modules (dialog boxes)
-   Connector Configuration Pages

These features are backed by ordinary web pages that are displayed in an
IFrame within the Microsoft Teams user interface. Tabs using the Azure
Active Directory Single Sign-On (SSO) option also need to implement a
web service to do a token exchange. Accessing these via `localhost` is
no problem; no tunnel is required.

[However Teams does require the web server to use a trusted https
connection or it won\'t display. ngrok translates trusted https requests
into local http requests, so it just works. But if you\'d rather not
have a tunnel to the Internet as part of your setup, you can do this all
locally. It\'s just more work.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

### [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#setting-up-a-trusted-https-server){#user-content-setting-up-a-trusted-https-server .anchor}Setting up a trusted https server {#toc-hId--2031226207}

On a NodeJS server, you can usually enable https by editing
the **.env** file and setting the `HTTPS` property to true. For .NET
projects in Visual Studio, under project properties on the \"Debug\"
tab, check the \"Enable SSL\" box to enable https.

But alas, just turning on the https protocol is generally not enough to
satisfy this requirement; the connection must be *trusted*. Trust is
established by a digital certificate; if the certificate comes from a
trusted authority, is up-to-date, and matches the hostname in the URL,
the little padlock in your web browser lights up and all is well. If
not, you get errors that you can bypass in most web browsers, but not in
Microsoft Teams.

The people over at ngrok acquired their certificate from a trusted
authority, and it\'s set to match hostnames ending in `ngrok.io`, so it
just works without any fuss. The local web server, on the other hand,
will most likely have a self-signed, untrusted certificate. So the trick
is to get your browser and/or Microsoft Teams to trust it.

An option that often works is to browse to the local server from a
regular web browser, click the security error, and tell the browser to
trust the certificate. You can then run Teams in the same browser and
bypass the issue. If the Teams client shares the same certificate store
as your browser, it will also work. However these default certificates
generally expire after a month or so, and the process will need to be
repeated.

A better option is to generate your own certificate and tell your
computer to trust it. That way you can control the expiration date and
reuse the certificate on multiple projects, so you only need to do the
setup once. This is explained in the article, [Setting up SSL for tabs
in the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio
Code](https://aka.ms/tabs-without-ngrok-article). The instructions are
for a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) application
using the Teams Toolkit but they shouldn\'t be too difficult to adapt to
other tool chains since the certificate creation and trust parts are the
same regardless.

### [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#mobile-device-testing){#user-content-mobile-device-testing .anchor}Mobile device testing {#toc-hId-456286626}

It\'s prudent to test Teams applications using the mobile versions of
Teams (iOS and Android) to make sure everything looks good and works
properly. ngrok makes this a breeze; since your local service is exposed
on the public Internet, you can test using any device with an Internet
connection, no special setup required.

If you\'d prefer not to expose your local server to the Internet, you
can always connect your phone locally using wifi and leave the Internet
out of it. This picture shows two phones; phone 1 is connected via ngrok
and phone 2 is connected locally.

[To set up local access you\'ll need a server name other
than]{style="font-family: inherit;"}[ ]{style="font-family: inherit;"}`localhost`[,
and you\'ll need to open a path on the local network from your phone to
your local web server. Here are the high-level steps; the details vary
depending on your phone OS, development computer OS, and network
configuration.]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

1.  Connect your mobile device via wifi to the same network as your
    development computer.
2.  Open an incoming port on your development computer\'s built-in
    firewall (port 3000, 3978, 8080, or whatever your local web server
    is using).
3.  Determine the local IP address of your development computer; ideally
    reserve it so it doesn\'t change. This can be accomplished in the
    DHCP section of most home routers or by using a fixed IP address.
4.  Set up a `hosts` entry (phones have them too!) or local DNS name to
    point to your development computer. Again, many home routers have
    the ability to register a local DNS name so you don\'t have to
    configure it in each device.
5.  Make sure the https certificate is for this same hostname and not
    just `localhost`, and install it as a trusted certificate on your
    phone.

While this might not seem easy, it is possible! And it\'s a one-time
setup that you can use over and over. But you can see that ngrok makes
it a whole lot easier.

Several features of Teams applications are based on a web service within
your application that is called from the cloud. These are:

-   Bots (called by [Azure Bot
    Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman))
-   Messaging Extensions (called by [Azure Bot
    Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman))
-   [Microsoft Graph change
    notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/webhooks?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman)
-   [Outgoing
    webhooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-outgoing-webhook?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman)

All of these are implemented as REST services and could be built with
any tool chain, but the requests will come from the cloud, so you need
to have a port listening on the Internet to receive those requests.

which are outgoing from Teams to your
app).]{style="font-family: inherit;"}

If ngrok isn\'t on your road map, don\'t worry, there are still options
available!

### [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#option-1-use-the-bot-framework-emulator){#user-content-option-1-use-the-bot-framework-emulator .anchor}Option 1. Use the Bot Framework Emulator {#toc-hId-441181517}

If you\'re building a bot, consider using the [Bot Framework
Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman),
which allows you to run bots locally without using the Azure Bot
Service. Instead of running your bot in Teams, you run it in the
emulator. The drawback is that the emulator doesn\'t currently
understand some Teams-specific features such as messaging extensions
or [other Invoke
activities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/bot-basics?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman#teams-specific-activity-handlers).
However it does a great job running conversational bots! Adaptive cards
work as well, though Invoke card actions do not.

If your bot isn\'t too Teams-specific, consider using the Bot Framework
Emulator for most debugging and just do final integration testing in
Teams, perhaps when the bot deployed in a staging environment which is
set up for handling incoming requests.

### [](https://github.com/BobGerman/BlogArticles/blob/drafts/What%20is%20ngrok%20and%20do%20I%20need%20it/article.md#option-2-dont-debug-locally){#user-content-option-2-dont-debug-locally .anchor}Option 2. Don\'t debug locally {#toc-hId--1366272946}

Another approach is to move away from the strategy of local debugging
entirely. For example, you could publish your app to Microsoft Azure app
service and use the remote debugger. Here are the instructions
for [Visual Studio Code
(NodeJS)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/remote-debugging?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) and [Visual
Studio 2019
(.NET)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/azure/vs-azure-tools-debug-cloud-services-virtual-machines?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman).

You could even set up a development virtual machine (VM) in Azure or
your cloud service of choice and open an incoming port for the Azure Bot
Service. Or just run ngrok in the VM, away from the concerns of a
corporate network.

Teams applications generated by the [yo
teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tutorials/get-started-yeoman?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) generator
have a single web server, so if your app has a combination of features -
say, tabs and a bot - you can use one ngrok tunnel or one for all your
application features.

Teams applications generated by the [Microsoft Teams
Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) generate
multiple web servers (one for tabs, another for bots, and a third for
the SSO web service if you use it). If you want to use ngrok, you\'ll
need a tunnel for each one. This requires the paid service and you\'ll
have to start up multiple copies each time you begin debugging. Another
option is to use a single ngrok tunnel for your bot, potentially with
the free service, and then use local connections for the tab and SSO web
service.

Of course you don\'t have to use either of these tools; they\'re really
just a convenience! You can use any tools you wish and create the Teams
application package in [App
Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) or
by editing your
own [manifest.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema?WT.mc_id=m365-27674-rogerman) file
and zipping it up with a couple icons.

While ngrok isn\'t a requirement for Teams development, it does make it
a lot easier. However if you can\'t or don\'t want to open up a tunnel
from the Internet, there are other strategies. Many of these, such as
local https servers with self-signed certificates, have been around for
a long time and may already be familiar.

There is nothing magic about Teams development! It was designed to use
standard web tooling, and you can use the same tools that you\'d use for
any web development project. Trust your knowledge of web development to
come up with a configuration that works for you. Just be aware of which
services will be called from the Internet and plan accordingly.
