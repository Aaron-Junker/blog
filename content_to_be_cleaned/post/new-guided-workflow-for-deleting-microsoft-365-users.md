As an IT admin, there are certain tasks and process that happen almost
daily. We're using customer feedback to identify those common tasks and
make them easier and faster to perform with repeatable results. Deleting
a user when they leave an organization is one of those common tasks.
From the IT side, it can take multiple steps to offboard a user. From
the business side, it can be easy to lose valuable data stored in the
user's documents and email.

 

We're combining the steps it takes to delete a user, retain their
documents, and retain their email into a single workflow with in-context
guidance. This guided workflow is available now to all Microsoft 365
admins.

 

**Start the process and decide what to do with licenses**

When a user leaves your organization, you should immediately block their
access to your Microsoft 365 subscription. This gives you some time to
decide what to do with their licenses, documents, and emails. The
Microsoft 365 admin center will walk you through each of these choices
when you start the delete process.

 

The first choice you'll need to make it what to do with that user's
licenses. If you purchased their licenses from a partner or through a
volume licensing agreement, their licenses will return to your available
pool so that you can assign them to another user. If you purchased the
licenses thorough a direct subscription and do not want to reallocate
them to a different user, you can also choose to reduce your monthly
spend.

li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-center image-alt="1.png" style="width: 999px;"}

 

 

**Assign OneDrive access**

The person leaving your organization may have stored important files on
their OneDrive that you want to retain for later use. In the guided
workflow for deleting a user, you have the option to assign access to
those files to anyone in your organization. Previously, your only option
was to assign access to their manager using Azure Active Directory, and
it was a multi-step process that only applied to OneDrive.

 

**Assign email access**

It can also be helpful to retain access to a deleted user's email. When
a user leaves your organization, you can convert their mailbox to a
shared mailbox and assign access to anyone within the organization. You
can change the display name, turn on automatic replies, and disassociate
aliases so that they can be used elsewhere. Automatic replies can be
especially valuable for anyone that had regular interaction with people
outside of your company, ensuring that you can maintain relationships
with your clients and vendors.

li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-center image-alt="3.png" style="width: 800px;"}

 

**Review your selections**

Once you've decided what you want to do with your deleted user\'s
licenses, files, and emails, you'll have the opportunity to review those
settings before you finalize the process.

li-use-hover-links="false"}]{.lia-inline-image-display-wrapper
.lia-image-align-center image-alt="4.png" style="width: 994px;"}

 

 

After selecting "Assign access and convert user," Microsoft 365 will
perform the requested actions and notify any user who now has access to
the emails and files.

**More actionable insights built in**

Our goal is to provide timely, concise help directly within the context
of the admin center so that you can deliver the highest possible service
quality to your end user. Look for more actionable intelligence and
guided workflows as we continue to improve the Microsoft 365 admin
experience. To stay up to date on the latest news and features for
Microsoft 365, join the conversation in the [Microsoft 365 Tech
Communities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-365/ct-p/microsoft365)
and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Microsoft365).
