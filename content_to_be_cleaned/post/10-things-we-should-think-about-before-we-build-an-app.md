With Power Apps, we can rapidly build custom business applications that
connect to our business data in a low code manner. This means that not
only professional developers can develop applications but that a lot
more people will be able to make apps that fit their specific use
cases.\
But as development is not only writing code, there are certainly some
things we should do before we hit make.powerapps.com. Many developers
will agree that development is 20% about writing code and 80% about
communications (meetings, gathering requirements, adjusting things).\
\
If we now introduce \'low code development\', we work on these 20%, not
on those 80%.\
The issue with that is that the narrative of \'everyone should make
apps\' doesn\'t reflect that there is much content out there to teach
business users how to use controls, components, connectors, and ask the
community when in doubt which function they should use. But there is
about near to zero guidance around making better decisions about how we
should approach building apps. Regardless of by whom it is developed,
every app needs to be documented, maintained, and supported.
Pro-developers are very aware of this, as DevOps is what they live and
breathe every single day. But apart from IT departments, who will need
to care about governance, application lifecycle management, etc., there
are some things on the business user side that we should consider.\
This post will list ten things that we should think about before we
start building our apps

## 1- which problem does the app solve? {#toc-hId--500239216}

This sounds obvious that one would first do a proper analysis of value
proposition and if the app they have in mind is a must-have solution to
a specific business case or if it\'s more or less \'yet another thing to
use\', although there are working alternatives in place.

### understand your market {#toc-hId-190322258}

Let us take some time to segment our market and understand who (even if
we build for our colleagues) needs our app. There will be roles that
will rely on our app, and it will become mission-critical to them.
Others will have already found applications that do similar things, or
the app doesn\'t solve a relevant problem. We can specifically look at
underserved groups, such as blue-collar workers, and see if we can
address their needs. Becoming obsessed with solving specific needs
without assumptions is critical here. This means that we will need to
validate the market that we have in mind. Even if we consider ourselves
a business user/power user /citizen developer, doesn\'t necessarily mean
that we are our user and precisely know what they need.

### psychological strain vs. energy of change {#toc-hId--1617132205}

To make users love an app, we will need to solve their pains or address
their needs and make it not too hard for them to change their behavior.
If the energy they will need to change their behavior is higher than the
psychological strain they face right now, they will not adopt your app.
It\'s unfortunately as simple as that.

## 2- calculate value {#toc-hId--1627635309}

Now you have a fair idea of who will use your app for which use cases
and also know what users are doing now:

 

-   abuse other tools
-   work on paper
-   purchase 3rd party tools
-   use unapproved shadow IT tools
-   and to which results this leads
-   be busy with tasks that don\'t add value
-   lose information
-   cause additional costs
-   severe risks in terms of data security, governance, compliance etc.\
    \
    tl;dr: it costs time &amp; money

 

But we need to make an effort to calculate the higher costs in terms of
money and time and make an estimation for the next 12 or 24 months in
order. This will also help with any approval process/ get funding.\
If the app we have in mind doesn\'t create (enough) value, we can take
this as a learning opportunity better to meet the needs of our
(internal) customers.\
\
The goal is to provide more value, not to deliver a poorly designed app
that costs a little less. Of course, we can build apps \'for fun\' or
because we want to learn, or \'just because we can\', but we should
carefully distinguish those apps from apps that we want to pitch and
\'sell internally\'.

## 3- scope {#toc-hId-859877524}

The mother of all questions: Does it scale? Will our app be something
for our personal productivity? Ease a workload for a small team? Or do
we talk about a mission-critical process? And even if we start with a
small group of users to try out, is there a way where a broader audience
could want to use it? We need to carefully identify our app\'s scope, as
this will impact many decisions.

## 4- data model {#toc-hId--947576939}

Let\'s talk about our data model. Which data source will you need to get
data, in which services will you write data? Which dependencies do you
have, which other apps, flows, bots will be part of the solution? Of
course, the consultant answer on when to use what will always be an \'it
depends\', but there are probably more reasons to look into different
data sources as you are aware of:

### licensing {#toc-hId--257015465}

As this is a pretty emotionally driven subject, we should handle this
some more cool-headed. The idea of first understanding which needs your
app solves, who would benefit from it, and how much money and time all
users would save together by using it is the licensing discussion\'s
counterpart. Of course, organizations tend not to want to pay for
additional licenses, but the idea that one could deliver excellent
business value without any costs is somehow romanticized. Incorporate
licensing fees for premium connectors (as you need them) in your
calculation, and if the app still delivers more value than it costs, we
will probably get approval/green lights for it.\
\
If the app isn\'t worth more than \~10\$ per month and user, we should
probably not be building it.

### performance {#toc-hId--2064469928}

The data sources we choose have not only impacted the licensing model
but also our apps\' performance. For instance, if data needs to travel
through an on-premises data gateway to a SQL server, most probably, our
app will not be as fast as if the data sits in Dataverse. For an
elaborated comparison on this and other data sources such as Excel,
SharePoint, and more, please read this article about [Considerations for
optimized performance in Power
App](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/considerations-for-optimized-performance-in-power-apps/)s

###  developer and user experience {#toc-hId-423042905}

We can also impact the experience you as a developer will have while
building the app, depending on the data source. If you ever \'loved\' to
deal with, for example, lookup columns from a SharePoint list, you will
agree that you didn\'t choose the easiest way to build an app. If you
need to find workarounds as a developer, this will impact your user,
which means that their experience won\'t be as good as possible.

## 5- delivery {#toc-hId-412539801}

Let\'s say we are about to make.powerapps.com, and we have a fair idea
of what to do there to make an app. We will publish our app, share it,
and mentally move on to something different. Now, who cares for that
app? Who will maintain our app? Things can easily change when we create
apps on top of cloud services. This can quickly become a not to be
underestimated workload, and probably we as a business user won\'t have
the capacity to cover that. And even if we are not talking about
adjusting to things that changed: Who will support our app? Who will
answer questions? Who will implement new features?

\
Delivery of software should contain code (and yes, this applies to Power
Apps) and proper documentation. Sharing knowledge about our app (what we
use, inputs, outputs, dependencies, licensing, data model,
accessibility, features, etc.) very early by writing it down to enable
those who need to maintain and support our solution is essential. Making
it a habit to have a changelog, where we document which features we add,
remove or change, is crucial. If we think that this is too
time-consuming, we should be aware that someone will need to spend more
time on fixing the lack of documentation for us. A lack of documentation
will create technical debt

## 6- what is your minimal lvable product? {#toc-hId-278855077}

Yes, I mean it! Define your minimal lovable product. If you only heard
about a minimal viable product so far, please read this article [How to
Build a Minimum Loveable
Product](https://medium.com/the-happy-startup-school/beyond-mvp-10-steps-to-make-your-product-minimum-loveable-51800164ae0c).
In essence? Which features will we need to make users fall in love with
our app? We will build this. We will not fall into the rabbit hole of
delivering the whole software in one piece but focus on the crucial
parts. Once we published our first version, we gather feedback on how we
can improve it. Becoming comfortable with a mindset that software is
never finished can be a good idea.

## 7- mock-up your app {#toc-hId--1528599386}

Finally- let\'s talk frontend - how shall our app look like? It\'s super
tempting to start building screens and buttons and decide on colors
etc., but we will get a better impression on the big picture of our app
if we first do a mock-up. We may choose to use a professional app for
that or if we will draw something (I personally do this in OneNote).
Defining which screens and buttons and forms and galleries you will need
will make the next steps easier.

## 8- componentize your app {#toc-hId-958913447}

Reinventing the wheel is always painful, and to avoid this, we can think
about components in our apps so that we reuse what we (or even others in
this environment in the component library) build before. While controls
are an excellent way to start learning and understanding how everything
works, components are the way to accelerate our process of making apps
and make sure that we easily adjust them and don\'t need to start over
again for the next app we are making. It is also the low-code equivalent
to the principle of \'Don\'t repeat yourself\'. Thinking upfront about
which controls we would repeatedly use and planning to componentize
these will ensure that we don\'t need to start all over again. You can
watch [April Dunnam\'s video about componetizing Power
Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO6RMYauAlY) to get up to speed.

## 9- accessibility {#toc-hId--848541016}

Accessibility is nothing that comes on top of a ready-to-publish app but
should be one of your core concepts straight from the beginning. The
accessibility checker in Power Apps is a good start, but it\'s always
worth exploring even more ideas. We can find lots of guidance on
ensuring that more people can benefit from our apps, [Microsoft
Inclusive Design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) is an
excellent go-to resource.

## 10- build in Microsoft Teams {#toc-hId-1638971817}

As we are more and more working in Microsoft Teams, we should not only
build applications for teams, but for (Microsoft) Teams! Considering the
context of apps gives you even more ways to satisfy user needs. Coming
back to the scope of our app, we need to carefully think if this app is
just for our team, or if we want to make it available for the whole
organization. Staying in Teams also has an impact on licensing, as you
can for instance use Dataverse for Teams, which is then seeded in you
Microsoft 365 license.

## Conclusion {#toc-hId--168482646}

As we could see, there are quite some things to do and think about
before we hit make.powerapps.com and I put these together as an approach
for good practices. What do you do before you actually start developing?
What would you like to add to my list?\
