[Microsoft Ignite](https://myignite.microsoft.com/home), our yearly
flagship event for Microsoft products and technologies, is a 48-hour
digital event experience taking place from September 22-24,
2020. Ignite, of course, is a very different event this year. On the one
hand, it is a single global event where everyone gets the same news,
information, content, and experience at the same time. But on the other
hand, I will miss the many personal connections that take place at our
in-person events. I look forward to the day when in-person events
resume, but until then, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share
with you now an amazing collection of video content covering the
incredible work being done across Microsoft 365.

 

Last year, the [[admin track at
Ignite](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/the-microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2019/ba-p/953950)]{.underline}
had several breakout, theater, and learning path sessions from a variety
of engineering teams, including:

-   the Microsoft 365 admin center team---the team that builds the
    Microsoft 365 admin center and admin mobile app;
-   Release and Delivery Experiences---the team that builds, among other
    things, Office.com and Office What's New;
-   Microsoft 365 Groups---the team that builds the Microsoft 365 Groups
    platform, membership service, and user experiences; and
-   Microsoft 365 Complex Orgs---the team that builds features and
    experiences to support customer mergers, acquisitions, and
    divestitures, and cross-tenant collaboration.

Since last Ignite, each of these teams has been immersed in customer
feedback and working hard to deliver your most-wanted admin experiences.
At an in-person Ignite, they'd be up on stage telling you all about what
they've been up to for the past year. But since we can't do that, I am
thrilled to announce that we've done the next best thing -- a digital
admin track!

 

The Microsoft 365 Admin Tools and Experiences track has a slew of new
videos that announce new features and ways to connect with Microsoft 365
engineering teams. These videos detail the new features and experiences
we have delivered and are delivering to you. They talk about what we've
done over the past year and why we've done it, and they give you a
glimpse into what we're doing next and why. Watch these videos not just
for the content, but also for the opportunities they give you to engage
directly with these feature teams and register your interest for
upcoming previews, roundtables, and other product team engagements.

 

There are 18 across three broad themes:

-   IT efficiency and agility;
-   [Modern cloud
    management](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-admin-guide-to-ignite-2020-part-2-modern-cloud/ba-p/1669526 "Modern cloud management");
    and
-   Investments in complex organizations

This post covers our investments for organizations that, as part of
their normal business routine, engage in merger, acquisition, split and
divestiture activities, and for organizations, partners, and admins that
manage multiple Microsoft 365 tenants. We refer to these types of
customers as complex organizations. And we're doing work across multiple
engineering teams to support these complex organizations.

 

## Meet the Speakers {#toc-hId--1267506448}

 

Let\'s meet the speakers first!

::: {.video-embed-center .video-embed}

###   {#toc-hId--576944974}

### **Microsoft 365 admins at Microsoft Ignite - <https://aka.ms/Admin10052>**  {#toc-hId-1910567859}

Calling all Microsoft 365 admins and IT Pros! This Ignite session
describes the slew of new learning videos that discuss new and recent
improvements to the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft 365 Groups,
and the investments we\'re making in complex organization/multiple
tenant scenarios.

###   {#toc-hId-103113396}

### **Supporting Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures in Microsoft 365​ --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1002**](https://aka.ms/Admin1002) {#toc-hId--1704341067}

Customers undergoing mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures often need
to migrate their data between Microsoft 365 tenants. When a customer
acquires a company with their own tenant, they are faced with the
decision around what to do with that tenant. Sometimes, it makes sense
to keep the tenants separate, such as in the case of conglomerates where
there is a lot of autonomy and independence between business units.

 

In other cases, customers need to transfer the acquired users and data
to their existing tenant. This is for a variety of reasons.  First,
users in the same tenant have the most feature-rich collaboration
experiences. In a single tenant, you automatically get a common
directory, the best Teams experience, etc. because everything is in one
tenant. While we are investing heavily to improve cross-tenant
collaboration, users in the same tenant will always get the richest
experience across the suite.

 

Other reasons include a size mismatch between the existing tenant and
the acquired tenant. In most cases, it doesn\'t make sense to keep small
tenants around in a large company. Companies with large well-managed
tenants with tens or hundreds of thousands of users usually don't want
to manage a bunch of very small tenants, in part because each tenant
adds management overhead.

 

Finally, there are also scenarios in which the whole tenant is not being
divested or acquired. Some acquisitions and divestitures involve "carve
ups," where only a subset of users and data are acquired and migrated.
Or some users are divested to one company and other users are divested
to another company. In these partial acquisitions and divestitures,
migration is the only option.

 

In a brand-new video​, Rob Lowe and Sesha Mani, members of the Microsoft
365 complex orgs team, talk about some of the challenges encountered by
complex orgs around data migration, branding, and so forth. They also
discuss Microsoft's vision for mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures,
where we see mergers and divestitures as two sides of the same coin,
where data can be migrated seamlessly and securely between tenants, and
key experiences, such as People Search, have the same experience across
tenants that we have within a single tenant.

 

In their video, Rob and Sesha have some fantastic demos showing new
experiences we have for cross-tenant mailbox migration and cross-tenant
SharePoint and OneDrive migration. There's also a great demo on domain
sharing for email, and cross-tenant People Search, two of the top
cross-tenant features that customers have been asking for.

 

Finally, Rob and Sesha talk about our plans for future improvements for
complex orgs, and they talk about the preview programs for these
features. Check out the video and use the links in it to indicate your
interest in the preview programs.

 

### **Multi-tenant management in the Microsoft 365 admin center​ --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1004**](https://aka.ms/Admin1004) {#toc-hId-783171766}

Did you know that more than 1/3 of all Microsoft 365 tenants are managed
by admins who manage multiple tenants?  In fact, this applies to 2/3 of
our enterprise customers, and the majority of our partners, as well. 
Multiple tenant scenarios arise a number of ways.  For example, in the
partner space, there are Cloud Solution Providers and Managed Service
Providers who manage tenants on behalf of their customers. And in the
enterprise space, there are merger and acquisition scenarios, separate
test and production environments, and in some cases, regulatory
requirements that drive multiple tenant scenarios.

 

Historically, the Microsoft 365 admin center was built for single tenant
admins and only recently did we start supporting admins who manage
multiple tenants. These admins face the same challenges as admins with
single tenants, except they have the additional complexity of having to
switch between tenants, and often the additional tasks of performing the
same work.  Our goal is to help multi-tenant admins spend less time
juggling tenants and more time doing meaningful work for them.

 

In a brand-new video, Tim Heeney, Principal Program Manager on the
Microsoft 365 admin center team, talks about the specific challenges
faced by admins who manage multiple tenants. He talks about who these
admins are, and where we are making investments in the multi-tenant
management space.  Equally important is why we are making these
investments, and as Tim explains in the video, we have prioritized our
work items based on direct customer feedback.

 

Tim also goes into detail about the most pressing issues around
multi-tenant management, such as switching between multiple tenants,
assessing the health and status of multiple tenants, performing
repetitive tasks against multiple tenants, and understanding
configuration differences between multiple tenants. He also describes
Microsoft's vision to create a unified management experience that allows
for multi-tenant administration from a single pane of glass.

 

Finally, Tim walks you through our plans to deliver on that vision.

 

### **Multi-tenant management: Service Health and Message Center --** [**https://aka.ms/Admin1006**](https://aka.ms/Admin1006) {#toc-hId--1024282697}

We publish a lot of information about Microsoft 365 services. For
example, the service health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center
provides a comprehensive view of the health of your services. If you are
experiencing problems, you can check service health to determine if the
issue you are seeing is a known issue before you call support or spend
time troubleshooting. The Message Center helps you keep track of
upcoming changes, including new and changed features, planned
maintenance, and other important announcements. As I mentioned before,
you can access both using the Microsoft 365 admin center and the
Microsoft 365 admin mobile app.

 

The feedback from admins who manage multiple tenants is clear:
service-related info and communications in the Service Health Dashboard
and the Message Center are critical to multi-tenant admins to provide
quality support to their users and to manage service changes.

 

In a brand-new video, Micky Saini, a program manager on the Release and
Delivery Experiences team, talks about the investments we are making in
these areas to provide multi-tenant admins with visibility into the
service health of their tenants and richer, actionable insights to
comprehend the impact to their tenants. We also want to improve
productivity for these admins by helping them to proactively support
their users by staying up to date on service incidents.

 

Micky talks about the admins we are serving with our multi-tenant
management investments, and why we are making those investments. He
talks about work we've already done, such as the awesome Tenant Switcher
in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and gives us a glimpse of what's
coming next in this space, such as a snapshot view for admins that
provides insights across service health, support requests, products &
billing, and setup recommendations.

 

Micky also provides you with details on how you can partner with
Microsoft to shape the multi-tenant experiences we are creating, and
details on how you can connect directly with the engineering teams that
are developing these features. Finally, in his demo, Micky walks you
through the new features in Service Health that are now part of the
multi-tenant admin experience.

 

If you manage multiple Microsoft 365 tenants, be sure to watch the video
and let us know what you think of our roadmap, and if there's anything
else we should focus on that can make your life easier.
