Topics discussed in this session include: \
\

-   Simon's role as Chief Technical Architect focusing on Modern Work in
    the Knowledge Factory within Advania.
-   Top of mind with customers right now -- Microsoft Viva and
    maximizing value of Microsoft 365 product investments - a strategy
    conversation. 
-   How you can use the Microsoft 365 Maturity Model with customers to
    measure their success/progress.
-   Change the place you work and change the way you work - hybrid,
    remote, asynchronous.   Microsoft Teams' evolution and a
    transitioning corporate culture -- meeting dynamics, remote
    synchronous vs asynchronous work, decision empowerment, knowledge
    sharing, and embracing a diversity of workstyles. 
-   Simon's latest important contribution to the Microsoft Graph
    Toolkit.    It all started with a blog post and a commitment to
    single sign-on in Teams.  
-   Why Simon contributes to open source?    It's a desire to learn,
    share, simplify, participate.  Mutual positive experiences as with
    working with the Microsoft Graph Team.
