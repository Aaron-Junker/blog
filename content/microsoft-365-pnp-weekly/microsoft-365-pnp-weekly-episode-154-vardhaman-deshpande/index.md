In this installment of the weekly discussion revolving around the latest news and topics on Microsoft 365, hosts – [Vesa Juvonen](http://twitter.com/vesajuvonen) (Microsoft) | @vesajuvonen, [Waldek Mastykarz](http://twitter.com/waldekm) (Microsoft) | @waldekm are joined by London/India - based Developer, Product Owner, Technical Architect, MVP, [Vardhaman Deshpande](http://twitter.com/vrdmn) (Valo Solutions) | @vrdmn.

Topics discussed in this session:

*   Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Platform development at Valo.
*   Vardhaman’s focus on tabs, bots and meeting extensions along with the development of an Ideation solution.

## This week 

*   **Waldek** – integrate MSAL/Angular with Teams (build a web app with SSO for Teams that works both inside Teams and outside Teams as a web app).  Improve Angular Development experience around Teams.   Working on new concepts for CLI for Microsoft 365.
*   **Vesa** – Family vacation this week.  Last week released SPFx v1.14 and working on new capabilities for v1.15 release by end of June.
