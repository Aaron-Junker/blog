## Community rocks

Our goal in the Microsoft 365 platform community (PnP) is to help everyone to extend Microsoft 365 and we offer free support as in 

- sample galleries
- tools
- blog posts
- community calls
- podcasts

to provide you with inspiration, examples and guidance. We strongly believe our community as a global movement to achieve more together. As there is always room for improvement, we came up with the idea to promote your samples on social media even more.

## Show us what you build

If you are building

- SPFx solutions
- SharePoint List formatting
- Microsoft Graph toolkit solutions
- Microsoft Teams apps
- Power Platform solutions
- Independent Publisher Connectors
- Scripts
- ...

then please let us know! Even if you already shared your samples somewhere, we want to give them more visibility and exposure in the [Unified Sample gallery at adoption.microsoft.com](https://adoption.microsoft.com/sample-solution-gallery). We will promote your samples on Twitter and LinkedIn and we also want to celebrate your contributions towards community and recognize your efforts. 

Contributors to the Microsoft 365 platform community (PnP) can opt-in towards our [recognition program](https://pnp.github.io/recognitionprogram/) and earn badges for their hard work. 

## Not sure where to start?

If you would love to share your work, but are not familiar with GitHub or how contributing works in general, we will guide you in our Sharing Is Caring initiave, where we provide you with hands-on guidance. We are all here and happy to help!
