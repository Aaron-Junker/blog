# PnP Script samples birthday blog

!Note: Must be ready for the 17th June

On this day, last year was the first release of the PnP Script Samples site. Wahoo **HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY!!!**

Check out the [Launch Tweet | Twitter](https://twitter.com/pkbullock/status/1405646438315565069?s=21&t=3jGXUj0ll9pPluDB0jWs9Q)

As of today, we have over XXX scenarios and XXX scripts that you can leverage in your projects.

_"It's been fantastic to see the excitement and engagement around the Script samples across the community. As we share our knowledge across the community members in the different formats, we are together much stronger and much more skillful to achieve the day to day objectives._

_Script samples is great example of how the community is sharing their knowledge between others for the benefit of all community members. Rather than everyone solving their objectives in isolation, we can focus on more important topics by sharing the general scripts between each other._

_We want to thank all community members who have been involved on the script samples. You are really the fuel of the community and showing the example on how sharing is caring"_  - **Vesa Juvonen (Principal Product Manager - Microsoft)**


## What is PnP Script Samples?

PnP Script Samples is a community resource provides a way to share your PowerShell or Bash scripts with the community written by the community Automate tasks with Microsoft 365 - using your favourite tools at this time, we have scripts for the following tools: 

- PnP PowerShell
- CLI for Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Graph SDK
- SPO Management Shell
- Teams PowerShell
- Power Apps PowerShell
- Whiteboard Admin PowerShell 

Another cool element of the scripts, is they are now integrated into the [Unified Sample Gallery | Microsoft](https://adoption.microsoft.com) giving greater reach and visibility of the samples - this is done automatically, without additional contributor effort.

We could not have done this without your support and would like to recognise the following contributors that made the project happen:

- XXX LIST ALL CONTRIBUTORS XX.

I'd also like to thank those that have retweeted, amplified and supported PnP Script Samples on social media platforms, additional to the [PnP Team](https://pnp.github.io/#team) for advice and help with progress the community project. **THANK YOU ALL!!**
