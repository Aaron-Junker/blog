Mastykarz](http://twitter.com/waldekm) (Microsoft) \| \@waldekm are
joined by Boston-based MVP and founder of Sympraxis Consulting - [Marc D
Anderson](http://twitter.com/sympmarc) \| \@sympmarc.  
Topics discussed in this session include: 


-   Hearing about how Sympraxis is focused on helping organizations
    function at higher levels.    
-   Differences in expectations between IT and non-IT customers.    
-   Non-IT is more interested in creating solutions people want to use
    and appreciate.  This is due in part to customers who use many great
    consumer technologies and they expect the same in their workplace.
      
-   Solution implementation options for architects have grown
    immensely.   
-   On a continuum of Code -- Middle Area -- No code, the activity for
    consulting firms today are greatest in the middle area.   User and
    IT education remains as important as ever.   
-   Discussion positioning Intranet and collaboration tools in
    organizations today - it\'s the tools for how we get work done that
    are rapidly evolving in the most interesting ways today.    

We also covered 13 articles by Microsoft and the PnP Community from the
last week.
