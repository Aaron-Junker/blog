The Microsoft 365 PnP Team would love to invite you to the Watch Party
that we are hosting for the **Learn Together: Building apps with
Microsoft Graph** event.
The event is a 2 hour live stream and is offered live twice to
accommodate the global audience:

April 14, 2021 2:00 pm AEST - 4:00 pm AEST (Asia Pacific Region)

April 14, 2021 8:30 am PDT 10:30 am PDT (North America & Europe Regions)

For the North America & Europe Regions live stream, we will host a Teams
meeting to connect and collaborate while we are watching the live stream
on our own devices. There will be games, popcorn, G-raphs ðŸ¦’ and much
more.

My dear Sharing Is Caring friend David Warner made a short video to
explain it in his own words!
