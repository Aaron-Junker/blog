## What do you do at work? 

 I am a consultant for Microsoft 365 services. Apart from that I am also part of a team who primarily develops the Digital workplace Apps related to Microsoft Teams. 

## Why are you a part of the M365 community? 

Because of the Awesome work the Microsoft 365 community is doing selflessly. More than that the inclusiveness which the community provides for all the contributors irrespective of who you are and where you are from. I have seen lot of my peers and colleagues who have got benefited from the work of the community and nothing is better than being part of the community owing to their awesome work across the Microsoft 365 areas. 


## What was you first community contribution? 

 First active contribution was back in July 2020 (17 July 2020 to be precise). From then on, there was no looking back for me. 


## One tip for someone whoâ€™d like to start contributing 

 Do not underestimate your contribution. You may think your contribution is so simple and it will not be beneficial to anyone (Let me confess, I also thought the same initially). With that you are underestimating the power of simplicity. It will be beneficial and may save a lot of time for someone who might be on the other side of the globe and can save his / her / theirs time. Be kind to people who contribute and support and be compassionate. Remember, people who are part of their community is doing this just out of sheer passion and ensure that you show gratitude and empathy. Remember community is there to help you and to support. I got that during my initial days and I am sure any contributor also will get similar treatment which I have received during my starting days.
