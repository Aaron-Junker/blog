Want to learn about how to leverage Fusion Teams and the Power Platform
to build applications faster and with less code?  


Join our experts at #PowerfulDevsConf on Sep 14, 8--11:30 PT (GMT+8).
You'll hear from community members, Microsoft MVP's and Microsoft
execs. This is a LIVE event with a variety of topics ranging from custom
connectors to ALM and more!
Scott Guthrie will kick things off with a fireside chat on why
code-first devs should embrace the Power Platform. And we have an
amazing closing keynote with Charles Lamanna and Amanda Silver as they
talk about all the latest and greatest innovations and their take on the
future of development.
