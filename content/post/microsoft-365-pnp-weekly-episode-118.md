The discussion included insights to the role of technical architect for
Microsoft 365 platform - both about designing solutions that solve
customer problems and as important - educating customers on the value of
the integrated platform.  Microsoft Teams vs SharePoint -- meet the
customer where they are at and coach from there.  "*Don't neglect to
deliver SharePoint training and don't focus solely on Microsoft
Teams.*"  And finally, the growth in partner opportunities as many
customers who quickly moved to M365 and the cloud in the last year are
now looking for guidance on how to leverage many more of the platform's
capabilities that they own.   Veronique is an active contributor to [PnP
PowerShell project](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/), as a champion
for Sys Admin users.
